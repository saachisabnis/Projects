Only 12 All-Star skaters will compete in Skills under a new format that will award a $1 million prize to the “King of Skills” – with the format summarized in this video.
* On the ice, Metropolitan Division foes separated by 10 points in the standings will renew their rivalry as Alex Ovechkin and the Capitals are expected to host Mika Zibanejad and the first-place Rangers.

FRIDAY’S RESULTS
The Flyers (22-14-6, 50 points) leapfrogged the Islanders for third place in the Metropolitan Division while the Predators (23-18-1, 47 points) overtook the Oilers for the first Wild Card position in the Western Conference with victories Friday.
ALL-STARS KONECNY, FORSBERG HELP FLYERS, PREDATORS SKATE TO VICTORIES
With the final 12 NHL All-Stars set to be announced Saturday, it was two players already selected for the 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend that made their mark Friday as Travis Konecny (0-2—2) and Filip Forsberg (1-1—2) helped the Flyers and Predators skate to wins.  
* After Konecny assisted on Philadelphia’s tying goal, Joel Farabee (2-0—2) scored his second tally of the game in overtime to help the Flyers secure their first multi-goal, third-period comeback win of the season. It marked the 300th comeback victory of John Tortorella’s career, making him just the ninth head coach in NHL history and fourth active bench boss to reach the milestone after Paul Maurice (337), Lindy Ruff (326) and Peter Laviolette (318).  
* Konecny extended his road point streak to 10 games and became the sixth player to post a double-digit run as a visitor this season, joining Anze Kopitar (11 GP), Trevor Moore (11 GP), Quinn Hughes (11 GP), Connor Bedard (10 GP) and Jake Guentzel (10 GP).
* Forsberg improved his team-leading total to 22-25—47 (42 GP) and helped the Predators (23-18-1, 47 points) create a two-point gap for the first Wild Card spot in the Western Conference. He can become the first player not named Roman Josi to lead Nashville in scoring at the end of the season since* Ryan Johansen in 2018-19. Should he do so, it would also mark the fourth time in his career he concluded a campaign as the Predators points leader (also 2017-18, 2015-16 & 2014-15), which would tie Josi (4x) and Cliff Ronning *(4x) for the most among all players.  
* Meanwhile, Josi (0-3—3), who was on the ballot for the 2024 NHL All-Star Fan Vote presented by MassMutual, factored on half of Nashville’s goals to climb some lists among active defensemen. Friday marked his 15th three-assist outing, which ranks sixth among active defensemen behind* Victor Hedman* (26),* Erik Karlsson* (25), Kris Letang (19), Quinn Hughes (18) and Cale Makar (16).
