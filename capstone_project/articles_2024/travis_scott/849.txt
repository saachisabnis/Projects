Future and Travis Scott have both made history on the Billboard 200 ‚Äî but for very different reasons.
On Sunday (September 29), Billboard revealed that the former‚Äôs Mixtape Pluto has debuted at number one on the albums chart after earning 129,000 equivalent units in its first week, largely through streaming.

The achievement means that the Freebandz boss is the first rapper ever to top the chart three times in six months, and the first act to do so since The Beatles almost 60 years ago.
Future previously debuted atop the Billboard 200 in March with We Still Don‚Äôt Trust You and again the following month with We Still Don‚Äôt Trust You, both of which were collaborative efforts with Metro Boomin.
Reacting to the news on his Instagram Stories, he wrote: ‚ÄúOOH SHIT! 3 #1s is Krazy work.‚Äù

Mixtape Pluto is also the Atlanta superstar‚Äôs 11th number one album, putting him joint fourth with Eminem, Kanye West, Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand on the all-time list.
Only Drake (13), JAY-Z (14), Taylor Swift (also 14) and The Beatles (19) have more.

While Future is celebrating a big week, last week‚Äôs chart king Travis Scott has suffered a historic drop.
Days Before Rodeo, the rapper‚Äôs 2014 mixtape, was finally given a commercial release in August and debuted at number two with over 360,000 equivalent units in its first week, losing out to Sabrina Carpenter in contentious fashion.

After a significant slump, the project enjoyed a historic rebound to number one in its fourth week, almost entirely due to vinyl sales which were the highest ever for a Hip Hop album.
A week later and Days Before Rodeo has dropped off the Billboard 200 completely, becoming the first album in history to go from number one to disappearing from the chart within the space of week.
