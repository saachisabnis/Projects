During the 66th GRAMMY Awards on Feb. 4, U2 will make history with the first performance broadcast from Las Vegas’ Sphere. Announced today via social media, this televised segment will bring the band’s acclaimed ‘U2:UV Achtung Baby Live At Sphere’ production from the futuristic venue to fans everywhere.
The legendary Irish rock band’s Sphere residency began in September to record-setting success; from the outset, fans and critics alike have praised the fusion of U2’s soul-stirring catalog and stage presence with Sphere’s unprecedented high-production presentation. After only nine sold-out performances, the series was extended to a total of 40 engagements running through March—three months longer than planned. To coincide with the event’s launch, U2 released “Atomic City,” a post-punk and new wave-influenced ode to Las Vegas that has been noted as a highlight of the concerts.
U2’s broadcast performance will join the ranks of seven previously-announced iconic acts: Burna Boy, Luke Combs, Olivia Rodrigo, Dua Lipa, Travis Scott, Billie Eilish and Billy Joel, whose appearance was publicized on Wednesday, Jan 24, just after the artist announced his first new release in over a decade. The Grammys will be broadcast live on Sunday, Feb. 4 at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on CBS and on demand on Paramount+.
