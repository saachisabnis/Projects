Travis Scott is keeping the sneaker world buzzing with the reveal of his latest creation: the Jordan Jumpman Jack “Bright Cactus.” After officially announcing the upcoming release of the much-anticipated “Mocha” colorway slated for November 26, La Flame is turning up the heat for summer with this vibrant and electric design.
The “Bright Cactus” colorway takes Scott’s debut signature shoe into bold new territory. Featuring a bright yellow canvas base paired with “Muslin” leather overlays and eyestays, these kicks are unapologetically loud—and we’re here for it. The iconic reverse Swoosh makes a triumphant return, flaunting black accents that also appear on the collar, tongue, and eyecatching stitched smile logo at the heel. Meanwhile, the “JACK” lettering on the outsole cements its place as a certified Travis classic.
Originally teased over the summer, the “Bright Cactus” was expected to drop during the 2024 holiday season. However, in true sneakerhead heartbreak fashion, the release has been pushed back to Summer 2025. While the delay is a bummer, the sneaker’s bold aesthetic makes it worth the wait.
Travis Scott’s ongoing partnership with Jordan Brand continues to redefine sneaker culture, with each release becoming an instant must-have. Fans don’t have to wait long to scratch their Travis itch, though—the Jordan Jumpman Jack “Mocha” is dropping next week, ensuring no one’s sneaker rotation feels neglected during the holiday season.
For those gearing up for the “Bright Cactus,” a specific release date hasn’t been confirmed yet, but keep your notifications set and your wallets ready. This one’s sure to be a summer showstopper, and you don’t want to miss the chance to snag what could easily become one of the most talked-about sneakers of the year.
