A$AP Rocky is finally ready to drop his first album in six years. 

	The Harlem rapper made his Paris Fashion Week debut on Friday (June 21) with his first AWGE collection entitled American Sabotage, and played three unreleased tracks during the collection’s show. Once the presentation concluded, a pre-save link went live revealing the album’s title — Don’t Be Dumb — and an August 30 release date. 

	Flacko wore some items from the collection during his Rolling Loud performance in 2023. He also played unreleased songs during his set with one song then-titled “Taylor Swift” causing a bit of controversy due to lyrics allegedly aimed at Travis Scott. “First you stole my flow/ So I stole your b—h/ Then you stole my style/ I need at least 10 percent/ All due disrespect, I hope you take offense,” Rocky rapped. The two have been going back and forth dating back to around 2015, when Scott was dating Rihanna and was accused by A$AP Nast for “stealing [A$AP Mob’s] swag.”

	In an interview with Dazed last year, Rocky said this album “feels like [his] best work yet.” However, he didn’t go into much detail, telling the outlet, “I want to leave expectations wide and open. I don’t want to tell you what to expect. I just want people to experience it how they do naturally.”

	Rocky has already released two singles, dropping “Same Problems” and “Riot (Rowdy Pipe’n)” in 2023. There’s no word on whether or not they’ll make the final cut for the album. 

	Adding to his fashion resume, the rapper and father of two recently starred in Bottega Veneta’s Father’s Day campaign with his sons RZA and Riot. Rocky became a brand ambassador for the Italian fashion house in 2022.
