Travis Scott‘s recent show in Brazil was so wild that it reportedly caused “earthquake-like” tremors felt as far as six blocks from the venue.
La Flame performed in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Wednesday (September 11), and between the vibrations from the speakers and the 46,000 engaged attendees, reports state that the mini-quakes could be seen from the naked eye.

Something similar happened last August 2023 following Scott’s Circus Maximus tour stop in Rome, where the concert activity sparked a 1.3-magnitude earthquake in the ancient city.

In other news, Travis Scott recently told Cultured Magazine that he’s “back in album mode” and “amped” about the new material that he’s working on.
During a conversation with George Condo — who designed the artwork for Scott’s “Franchise” single, as well as Kanye West‘s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy — he said to Travis: “I remember we were in Electric Lady [Studios] and you were like, ‘I want four chords on a piano.’

“All of a sudden you had that little microphone next to you, and you’d say something like, ‘I’m gonna juggle my urges.’ Would you ever go back and work again in that studio?”
The Houston native replied: “I’m gonna be back in New York. I’m back in album mode. I’ve been working on music and shit every day on tour. When I’m doing the stadiums, because they’re sold out, I can see the music for what it is. I’m fucking amped.”
