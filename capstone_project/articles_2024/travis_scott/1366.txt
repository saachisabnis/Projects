Future and Metro Boomin have finally dropped off the first installment in their joint album series, WE DON’T TRUST YOU.
Clocking in at approximately one hour, the 17-track effort features guest appearances from the likes of Travis Scott on and “Cinderella,” and Playboi Carti on “Type Shit” — all of which were previewed at Rolling Loud California just a few days ago — as well as Kendrick Lamar and Rick Ross.
Pluto and Young Metro’s incredible artistic chemistry isn’t a secret, but on WE DON’T TRUST YOU, they take their long-standing partnership to the next level. The pair plays off of each other’s strengths and are able to step up in the respective aspects that they’re lacking, creating a balanced and cohesive joint offering. Future, armed with his cool and collected tone, effortlessly rides on Metro’s stellar and intuitive production like a moth to a flame. There’s a reason as to why the two are considered one of modern hip-hop’s favorite matchups, and although it took them a little while longer to drop a collaborative record, it’s easy to say that it was well worth the wait.
