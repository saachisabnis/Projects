An Osage County judge has sentenced Zachary Millard to life in prison for orchestrating the 2021 murder of fellow Irish mob member Mitchell Roberts. The Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, along with partner agencies, managed the case against Millard, who was found guilty earlier this month for the crime committed in Tulsa.
Investigations by the Tulsa Police Department and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) revealed that Millard, an inmate at Dick Conner Correctional Center in Hominy, used a contraband cell phone to coordinate Roberts' murder.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond emphasized the significance of preventing contraband from entering prisons. "This incident highlights how critical it is to keep contraband from entering correctional facilities,” he stated. “When inmates gain access to prohibited items like cell phones, it undermines the safety of both prison staff and the public."
Drummond acknowledged prosecutor Heather Anderson and agents Tom Helm and Marlin Warren for their contributions. The prosecution involved collaboration with the Osage County District Attorney’s Office.
Brett Mize, first assistant district attorney for District 10, remarked on the message sent by this conviction: “This conviction sends a strong message that prison gang members will be held accountable for their activities to perpetrate violence inside or outside the prison walls.”
Travis Pickard, HSI Special Agent in Charge overseeing operations in North Texas and Oklahoma, expressed satisfaction with the outcome: “For years, this violent gang member’s crimes brought fear and devastation to our community, and today justice has finally been served.”
Millard received a life sentence with parole eligibility for murder. Additional sentences include 30 years for burglary, one year for conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor, and five years for gang-related offenses. These sentences are consecutive.
Six co-defendants linked to this crime have pleaded guilty: Ryan Scott Luna, Jacob Kyle Shelton, Donald Tippy Jr., Kacy Ray Delaney, Levi Dalton, and Christopher Polhamus. The alleged shooter Christopher Taylor died before facing charges.
