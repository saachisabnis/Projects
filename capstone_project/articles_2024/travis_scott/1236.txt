Kansas City Chiefs Left Guard Joe Thuney will not play in Super Bowl LVIII against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, February 11. Thuney suffered a pectoral injury and has been unable to play in the AFC Championship and the forthcoming Super Bowl.
Thuney will be replaced by Nick Allegretti. Allegretti played for the Kansas City against the Baltimore Ravens during the AFC Championship. In five seasons with the franchise, he’s started in 13 regular season games and four playoff games, including Super Bowl LV. However, the Chiefs hopes to fare better than they did against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021.
Thuney will not be the only offensive lineman missing action on Sunday. Prince Tega Wanogho will also miss Super Bowl LVIII after suffering a quad injury. Also, Kansas City Chiefs Running Back Jerick McKinnon has been listed as questionable after sustaining a groin injury.
In more positive news for the Chiefs, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, Rashee Rice and Travis Kielce are expected to play despite dealing with various ailments in recent weeks.
The Chiefs will meet the 49ers at Allegiant Stadium on Sunday, February 11. Kickoff is scheduled for approximately 6:35 p.m. EST.
