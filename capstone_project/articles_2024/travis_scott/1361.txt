RM Sotheby’s is set to unveil an eclectic mix of memorabilia in its upcoming “Dare to Dream Collection” this year. Among the prized possessions up for grabs are not just classic automobiles like the 1996 Ferrari F50 and 2015 McLaren P1 but also a treasure trove of sought-after sneakers and sports-themed rarities.
One of the most anticipated items in this diverse collection is a pristine, deadstock set of Virgil Abloh’s groundbreaking Off-White™ x Nike collaboration, famously dubbed “The Ten.” Despite some yellowing due to age, these sneakers remain a testament to Abloh’s influence on contemporary sneaker culture. Alongside these coveted kicks, collectors will have the chance to bid on the iconic 1972 Nike Waffle Racing “Moon Shoe,” a rare glimpse into Nike’s storied history.
But the offerings don’t stop there. Enthusiasts can also expect to find other gems like a fresh pair of the Nike SB Dunk Low “Paris,” iterations of the Nike MAG from 2011 and 2016, and three exclusive Travis Scott x Air Jordan 4s.
The “Dare to Dream Collection” preview will take place on May 31 in Toronto, Canada, just ahead of the Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada in Montreal. The auction itself will span May 31 and June 1, offering collectors the chance to own a piece of sneaker and automotive history. Key price estimates range from $15,000 to $25,000 for the complete Off-White™ x Nike “The Ten” set and $200,000 to $300,000 for the legendary 1972 Nike Waffle Shoe, both available without reserve.
