Rick Ross has continued trolling 50 Cent by offering him the chance to go into business with him.
Referencing 50 making major moves in the film and TV industry with his new studio facility in Shreveport, Louisiana, Rozay reached out to his longtime foe on Instagram with a money-making proposition.

Wearing a Star Wars T-shirt, Ross said: “I was just asked a question, ‘I see what’s still going on with you and 50 Cent. You mean you won’t do no business with 50 Cent?’ I would.
“50 Cent, I see you raising money for your film ideas, you asked a close friend of mine. I saw the renderings, the drawings of what you believe your studio could be like in Shreveport.”
Rozay continued: “I’ma give you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to come sit down at the table and present your ideas. I won’t make you any promises. Men of business don’t discuss the past. It’s new money, I’ll consider it. You know where I’m at financially. I can change your life.”

In a separate post, the MMG mogul boasted about all of his brand partnerships and business dealings with companies such as Rap Snacks and said he could put 50 Cent’s face on a bag of potato chips.
He signed off his video by saying: “We got business to do, 50.”
Rick Ross’ sarcastic posts come shortly after he taunted 50 Cent over his ex-girlfriend Jamira “Cuban Link” Haines‘ rumored romance with Travis Scott.
Haines, a model and fitness entrepeneur, was spotted leaving an event with the Houston rapper last week, with the pair stepping into a car together and reportedly heading back to a hotel.

After Akademiks posted the footage on Instagram, Rozay wasted no time in trolling 50 by commenting: “The massacre @50cent.”
He further taunted his rival by re-posting the suggestive clip to his Instagram Stories and quoting lyrics from his classic song “Many Men (Wish Death)”: “Many men, many many many many men — @50cent [peeking eyes emoji].”

In a follow-up post, Ross shared a video of his shoe collection and declared he was swapping his customary Louis Vuittons for Travis Scott’s Cactus Jack Jordan sneakers.
“No Louis Vuittons today. No, no, no. We wearing Travis Scotts all week. I’m going to Club LIV in them Travis Scotts,” he joked.
