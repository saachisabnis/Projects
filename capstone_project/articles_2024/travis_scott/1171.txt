Young Thug isn’t wasting any time getting back to work after his release and was recently seen in the studio with Future, Travis Scott and Lil Baby.
During a stream on Monday (November 11), Akademiks alleged the four superstars had gotten together in the lab, and a short slip of the session surfaced online soon after.
“Don’t ask me how I got the picture, but I appreciate all the people that were there. Young Thug has linked up in the studio with all these individuals,” Ak said. “I gotta think they’re either still working on whatever’s coming out for Baby. I think this was the Avengers of n-ggas linking up. This was the ‘Fuck Gunna Avengers.’”
Fans believe London On Da Track may have also been involved, as hours earlier, he shared a photo from Travis’ private jet, which would mean he was with the Houston rapper.

Meanwhile, Young Thug has also been cooking up with both Metro Boomin and T.I. since his release on October 31.

In a post to his Instagram Story last week, Metro shared a look at his computer screen – which featured a studio session for a song titled “Jeff Home,” referring to Thug’s real name, Jeffery.
While he didn’t give any further context, it feels safe to assume the pair may be dropping something off in the near future.
Days earlier, Thug reunited with one-time mentor T.I. and also appeared to be working on something.
“Aye, man. What you gotta tell these people?” T.I. asks Thug in a video they shared, to which Thug replies: “Back, Jack […] No cap in my rap. The right way.”
