Early yesterday morning, Travis Scott was arrested in Miami on charges of disorderly intoxication and trespassing. Officers were apparently called to the Miami Beach Marina, where a charter boat owner was demanding that Scott get off his boat and leave the area. According to police reports, the rapper “became irate, screaming profanities, left and returned to disturb some more.” Scott was arrested at 1:17 a.m., before eventually being booked at 4:35 a.m. at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. Scott has apparently already responded to his arrest by tweeting out a dismissive, “Lol,” on X at 7:45 a.m. on Thursday. No word yet on whether or not he will have to appear in court. (Uproxx)
