Adele confirmed she’s engaged to Rich Paul during a fan interaction at a concert in Munich. In clips shared on social media, Adele reads a sign held up by a fan. “‘Will you marry me?’ I can’t marry you, because I’m already getting married,” she says, holding up her ring finger. “So, I can’t. But I appreciate it.”
Adele was first romantically linked to the NBA agent in early 2021, following their initial meeting on a dance floor at a mutual friend’s birthday party.
“Rich and I have always known everything about each other since the day we got together,” the singer said in a 2023 interview with The Hollywood Reporter.
