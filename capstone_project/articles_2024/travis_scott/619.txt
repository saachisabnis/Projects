Timothée Chalamet left Joe Jonas on read, and a year later, the singer is still waiting for a response.
Jonas, 35, posted a TikTok on Monday, December 2, that showed the unanswered message. It came last December and included a selfie of Jonas with the words “miss you.”
“Last December I sent Timothée Chalamet a text from my friend’s phone anticipating a response,” he wrote over the image.
On the next slide, he posted another selfie with the text, “This December he still hasn’t texted me back. Hope this helps!”
Jonas’ fans seemed to have his back.
“I totally understand how you feel, Joe. I am also waiting on a response from the Timothée Chalamet,” one fan wrote.
“He’s just thinking of a good response,” another added.
A third pointed out what many fans were probably thinking, writing, “At least you’ve got his number. I have to do it over Instagram.”
But Jonas doesn’t even have Chalamet’s number. He replied to that post, admitting, “I don’t have his number, my friend has his number lol.”
To be fair, Chalamet, 28, has had a busy year — he could be forgiven if a response slipped his mind. The actor released Dune: Part Two in March and stars in the upcoming Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown.
In July, he agreed to star in Marty Supreme, in which he will portray a fictionalized version of pro table tennis player Marty Reisman. Principal photography for the movie began in September and is on track to become A24’s most expensive movie ever.
And that’s all while trying to maintain his relationship with Kylie Jenner, whom he began dating in 2023.
“Kylie and Timothée hang out with each other frequently and communicate on a regular basis,” a source close to the couple exclusively told Us Weekly in July. “They’ve gone on a number of dates recently, but they always do their best to try and stay under the radar as much as possible.”

Jonas hasn’t exactly been kicking back, either. He is working on his second studio album, Music for People Who Believe in Love, which was initially scheduled for an October release before he decided to hold off as he continues to add the finishing touches.
He and Sophie Turner finalized their divorce in September. The two share daughters Willa, 4, and Delphine, 2.
“After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the U.S. and the UK,” the two announced in a joint statement on September 5.
