In one soundless clip, Khaled and La Flame nod their heads along before a cut reveals footage of Travis laying down bars. The “I’m the One” artist also pulls out a lighter, bringing stadium energy to the backstage link up.

Khaled captioned the post: “Soon as I played the beat la fame said turn mic on, ofcourse I agreed new album in works.” He added: “FANLUV WORLDWIDE. CANT WAIT TO SHARE THIS NEW ALBUM EXPERIENCE WITH YOU.”
The “Wild Thoughts” hitmaker has been making headlines recently for all the wrong reasons, after a video of him eating snails while at a restaurant went viral.

In the clip, which was shared to his Instagram account, Khaled looks into the camera while bragging about the delicacy while quickly tearing through the appetizer portion.
Jokes flew because Khaled has said in the past that he won’t perform oral sex on his longtime wife, Nicole Tuck.

Though Travis Scott is currently recording music before and after tour dates, last year he revealed plans for when he retires from the music industry.
