Penelope Disick and her pals enjoyed some fun in the sun for her 12th birthday.
Kourtney Kardashian gave a glimpse of her and ex Scott Disick’s daughter’s epic beach bash via Instagram on Sunday.
“12 years young 🎈🌴🎡☀️🌊💘,” the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum, 45, captioned footage of the preteen’s party.
The reality star showed the birthday girl’s floral cake before sharing clips of Penelope and her friends walking in their bathing suits, splashing in the shallows and riding a Ferris wheel.
The little ones had a sweet set up on the sand, lounging under pink umbrellas in matching chairs atop striped towels.
Social media users raved over the “Kardashians” star letting her “kids be kids” with the “perfect” party, while her husband, Travis Barker, commented, “Happy Birthday Penelope 🥳🥳🥳.”
As for Penelope’s dad, Scott posted a touching tribute to his “little girl who isn’t that little anymore” via Instagram last week.
“Happy birthday,” the Talentless creator, 41, gushed. “Words could never describe how much u mean 2 me.”
He and Kardashian, who broke up in 2015, are also the parents of sons Mason, 14, and Reign, 9.
Additionally, the Poosh creator welcomed son Rocky, now 8 months, in November with Barker.
The Blink-182 member, 48, is already the father of son Landon, 20, and daughter Alabama, 18, with ex-wife Shanna Moakler and remains close with his former stepdaughter, Atiana De La Hoya.
After Rocky’s arrival, the couple struggled to balance the infant’s needs with their older children.
“I have kids all different age ranges — preteen, teenage, adults, an infant. So I really try to set aside one-on-one time with each,” Kardashian said on Thursday’s episode of her family’s Hulu show. “I don’t want to miss anything.
“It’s like a feeling of being pulled in different directions, like wanting to be everything to everyone,” she continued.
Kardashian and Barker got married in 2022 but didn’t blend their families and officially move in together until the following year.
