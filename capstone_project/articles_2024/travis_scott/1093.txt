Former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce made his latest roster move official, joining the ESPN family on Tuesday.
Kelce, who retired in March after 13 NFL seasons, will be part of the "Monday Night Countdown" crew.
"Turns out, it was a short retirement! I'm excited to join ESPN, and particularly the Monday Night Countdown team," said Kelce, 36. "ESPN was a consistent presence in our household growing up and the network helped shape who I am and my love of all sports. To now appear on that same screen is a full circle moment. And, I mean it's freaking Monday Night Football! and I'm ready for some football."
Kelce joins Scott Van Pelt, Ryan Clark, Marcus Spears, Adam Schefter and Michelle Beisner-Buck on the team.
"Jason is a highly respected, Super Bowl Champion with a strong connection to fans," ESPN president of content Burke Magnus said. "Walking off the field and immediately to ESPN, viewers will benefit from his perspective which has been shaped through his years as an established locker room leader and a future Hall of Fame center. Jason's addition to Monday Night Countdown will greatly strengthen our NFL coverage."
Kelce's services were also reportedly sought by CBS, NBC and Amazon.
Drafted in the sixth round (191st overall) in 2011, Kelce became a Super Bowl LII champion and one of the most durable, decorated and respected centers in NFL history -- and one of the league's most passionate players.
The six-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowl selection started 205 games for the Eagles, including the postseason.
Kelce is the older brother of Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce. The siblings have a popular podcast called "New Heights."
