Kid Cudi revealed the full tracklist for his Insano album on Monday (January 8). The forthcoming body of work includes contributions from several rap stars.
Insano hosts a song titled “X & Cud” with vocals by the late XXXTENTACION, who was fatally shot on June 18, 2018. Kid Cudi also enlisted Young Thug for Insano. The currently incarcerated Atlanta native, who’s on trial for various RICIO and firearm charges in Georgia, appears on “Rager Boyz.”

Kid Cudi’s Insano also features DJ Drama, Travis Scott, A$AP Rocky, Lil Yachty, Pharrell Williams and Lil Wayne. The 21-track studio LP arrives on Friday (December 12) via Republic Records.
The project serves as the follow-up to 2022’s Entergalactic, which accompanied the Netflix animated music television special of the same name.
Young Thug dropped 2023’s Business Is Business album while locked up in the Cobb County Jail. Two XXXTENTACTION projects—2018’s Skins and 2019’s Bad Vibes Forever—came out after his death.
