We teased it in last week’s qW and now it’s here! We’re kicking off CORE, NCPA’s new revolutionary approach to training pharmacy owners and their team members on the most essential elements of team leadership. Drummed up by pharmacist/attorney Scott Pace and led by talented, successful pharmacists and subject matter experts—Kelley Babcock, Terri Norvell, the team with Sykes & Co. CPAs, Dave Wendland, Travis Wolff, and more—NCPA’s yearlong CORE program has been designed to improve confidence and experience in areas where pharmacy owners say they often feel least equipped. Where there may not have been much focus during school or earlier in their pharmacy career. This includes developing and launching meaningful marketing campaigns, maximizing staff, and creating business plans when starting new services. Participants can be pharmacy owners, managers, or other team leaders. They will join one live virtual session each week along with a limited small group of others going through the program, and have in-person networking and learning sessions at the NCPA Annual Convention in October. There are also optional one-on-one consulting opportunities for additional help implementing practical, meaningful changes into their business.
Enrollment for the inaugural cohort of NCPA’s CORE program is open now through May 31; here’s where to find more information and sign up. The course will kick off in June with an orientation session to introduce participants to the program. To hear Pace talk about CORE in greater detail, check out April’s Independent Rx Forum podcast.
