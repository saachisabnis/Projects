Travis Barker took to Instagram to celebrate his wife Kourtney Kardashian's 45th birthday and shared a sneak peek photo of their son, Rocky Thirteen.
The Blink-182 member treated followers to a carousel of photos in honor of the reality star's birthday, on Thursday, April 18. Among the snapshots included a rare glimpse of their 5-month-old son.
"Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife, soulmate and best friend forever. I love you, I love our life together," he wrote as the caption. "Thank you for being the most amazing wife a person could ask for. Here's to many more years of adventures together ❤️‍🔥."
In the second photo of the slide, Kardashian was captured cuddling up to Rocky in bed. The third photo showcased Barker holding Rocky outside a plane, while the couple shared a kiss. In this photo, Kardashian and her son wore matching black and white striped pajamas.

"Husband of my dreams. I love our life!!," Kardashian responded to the post. Some of her family members also went to the comments to display their love. Khloe Kardashian wrote, "❤️❤️❤️❤️," while Kylie Jenner said, "last pic for me 🤣🥹🥹🥹," referring to the photo of the Poosh founder sitting on the toilet.
This isn't the only time Barker went to social media to show his affection for his wife. "Happy Valentine's Day my beautiful wife 🖤," he wrote on Instagram in February, alongside a slide of some PDA moments of the pair.
The Lemme founder welcomed Rocky in November 2023, marking her first child with husband Barker, whom she married in May 2022. Kourtney also shares three children with her former partner Scott Disick: Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9. Meanwhile, Barker is also a father to Alabama, 18, and Landon, 20, and stepfather to Atiana De La Hoya, 25, from his previous marriage to Shanna Moakler.
