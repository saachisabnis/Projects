Ahead of the show, Gunna said: “Afrobeats, Nigeria, and African music itself is coming in big. It’s taking over the next wave"
Gunna surprised fans at his first show in Nigeria by inviting Tyla on stage to perform their single ‘Jump’. Check it out below.
The Atlanta rapper was headlining Lagos Flytime Fest, a four-day festival that celebrates music from the African Diaspora. Previous years have seen the likes of Megan Thee Stallion, Wizkid and Burna Boy perform.
During Gunna’s performance to 5,000 people at Lagos’s Eko Convention Center last night (December 22), he played a string of his biggest hits, including ‘One of Wun’, ‘Drip Too Hard’, and ‘Yosemite’, before introducing Tyla to the stage.
‘Jump’ comes from Tyla’s debut, self-titled album released earlier this year. It’s not the first time they’ve played the hit live together, having performed it at the BET Awards earlier this year, alongside Skillibeng.
After they wrapped up ‘Jump’, together, Gunna gave Tyla the stage to play her latest single ‘Push 2 Start’, where she handed her mic to an audience member to sing along.

Ahead of his performance, Gunna spoke in a press conference with Flytime Promotions’ CEO Cecil Hammond, saying: “Afrobeats, Nigeria, and African music itself is coming in big. It’s taking over the next wave. With my music, it resonates.” He went on to promise this wouldn’t be his last performance in Nigeria, per Rolling Stone.
Tyla’s debut self-titled album came in at Number 19 on NME’s 50 Best Albums of 2024 list, with the entry reading: “The South African pop princess’ debut album makes good on the promise of her Grammy-winning breakthrough hit ‘Water’. Featuring cameos from Tems and Travis Scott, it’s a fresh, club-ready blend of R&B, dancehall, amapiano and Afrobeats that proves Tyla can mine a vibe all of her own.”
We spoke to the star in March last year, where she discussed the importance of bringing African artists more attention. “I just feel like everything is so new and everyone is different, but we have a vibe that comes with us. Like Amapiano, it’s a whole genre we created back home in South Africa and it has dance moves: it’s a whole movement.
“We’ve been partying with it by ourselves, but now other people are enjoying it and I’m loving that. I love that people are seeing a different side of Africa. People are seeing it for what it is, and the artistry and creativity that we have.”
