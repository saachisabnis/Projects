Kid Cudi may have started a new wave with his latest promotional campaign.
Video submitted to KTLA by Mauricio Tassara (IG: @empty_drone) shows a nearly 30-foot-tall statue of the rapper floating on a barge along the shoreline near Palos Verdes on Friday, hours after his latest album “INSANO” was released.

The statue sailed along the Long Beach shoreline from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday before docking in Alamitos Bay.
A post from the Cleveland native indicated that a similar statue was propped up in Paris earlier this week to promote the 21-track album, which features big names like Pharrell Williams, Travis Scott and Lil Wayne, among others.
Officials in Long Beach addressed the statue in a statement on social media, saying that the statue was part of a promotional event and that those looking to view the statue could do so from any beach within the city.
