21 Savage is grateful for all the success he’s obtained, but he does regret that it keeps him away from his children more than he would like.
Amid his wide ranging interview on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast, which was published on Wednesday (January 24), the American Dream rapper got into the topic of parenthood. He shared that, in his opinion, 21 feels that life is actually better for your kids when you’re less successful, as you’re able to spend more time with your family.

“I be feeling like I don’t be doing all the way my job because of my job,” he explained. “So I be tryna balance that out. It’s like you work to gain all this success and all the good shit, but I feel like the best parents – in my opinion – is parents that don’t got it all. I feel like broke parents are better than rich parents, in my opinion, because when you broke, you got way more time.
“So you there for a lot of shit. Yeah gifts and shit matter, but they won’t matter at the same time,” he concluded, before agreeing with Shannon, who added: “Sometimes all a kid needs is your time.”
Elsewhere in his sit-down with Shannon Sharpe, 21 Savage admitted that his American Dream biopic isn’t real after all.
“That was a parody,” he said. “I feel like it could be [a real movie] one day. They’ll hate on it now, though, ’cause they going to be like, ‘What the fuck 21 Savage deserve a story for? […] What he did?’”

An official press release for the film was sent out by Epic Records earlier this month and claimed that Donald Glover and Stranger Things‘ Caleb McLaughlin would share the role of the London-born star.
The movie ended up being a music video for 21’s song “all of me,” which did actually feature Glover and McLaughlin as the Slaughter Gang boss at different ages. Metro Boomin also makes an appearance in the clip.
