With Tuesday’s primary election in the books, Utah County residents now have a good indication which candidates will be on the ballot in November’s general election.
Ballots in Utah County included multiple seats for the state Legislature, state and local school boards, state and county government races and Utah’s 3rd Congressional District.
Heading into Tuesday’s primary, early voting in the county seemed to lag with less than 20% of Utah County ballots processed as of Monday evening.
State Senate District 22
In Senate District 22, incumbent Sen. Heidi Balderree, was ahead by a considerable margin last Tuesday. The state’s election website was reporting the Saratoga Springs senator had 46.58% of the vote over Emily Lockhart’s 35.87%, while Garrett Cammans had 17.55%.
Balderree took over the remainder of Sen. Jake Anderegg’s term after he resigned last fall. The district contains parts of Lehi, Saratoga Springs and Eagle Mountain and a small portion of Draper in the Salt Lake Valley.
State House District 58
In House District 58, preliminary results showed David Shallenberger up 57.68% to Holly Sweeten’s 42.32%. Both candidates are from Orem.
Sweeten is a staffer for U.S Rep. Burgess Owens. Neither received 60% at the county convention to gather a Republican Party nomination.
State House District 61
It could be another tight race in House District 61. Unofficial results showed Lisa Shepard narrowly edging Travis Hoban 50.95% to 49.05% as of around 8:45 p.m.
Hoban currently serves as a Provo city councilman and Shepherd is the current senior policy advisor for County Commissioner Tom Sakievich. Both are vying to replace Rep. Marsha Judkins, who is not seeking reelection. Shepherd received the party nomination during the county convention in April, with Hoban gathering signatures.
State House District 66
In House District 66, Republicans Brian Nielson and Troy Shelley were vying to advance to the general election this fall.
Results so far showed Nielson in the lead with 55.56% of the votes to Shelley’s 44.44%. The winner would go on to the November ballot in hopes to represent Juab and Sanpete counties.
Nielson was the executive director at the Utah Department of Corrections, a role he retired from in May 2023. Shelley formerly served as chair of the Sanpete County Republican Party.
State School Board District 10
A tight race was brewing in District 10 between incumbent Matt Hymas and Monica Wilbur.
Preliminary results showed Wilbur in a slight lead with 52.10% of the votes compared to Hymas at 47.90%.
The district contains Eagle Mountain and Saratoga Springs.
Wilbur has the support of current state school board member Natalie Cline, who came under fire earlier this year after posting a photo of a teenage athlete and falsely implying she was transgender, leading to a slew of online attacks against the girl.
Earlier this year, Wilbur barely edged incumbent Hymas 52.2% to 47.8% during the state school board convention.
State School Board District 13
In District 13, preliminary results showed Randy Booth ahead with 56.04% of the vote while Cari Bartholomew was at 43.96%. This district includes Provo and Nebo school districts.
A third candidate, Alyson Robertson, withdrew from the race after the county convention.
Local school board races
Alpine school board, District 5: Mark Clement led the field of contenders with 50.95% of votes, and John Gadd totaled 27.21%. They will move on to the general election in November.
Nebo school board, District 7: B. Scott Wilson, with 46.81% of the votes, will advance and face Carma Heimuli, 29.78%.
The certified results should be posted on the county clerk’s website sometime on July 3.
