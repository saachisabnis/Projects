Oreo recruited a superstar collaborator for its next flavor.
The cookie brand announced Wednesday it’s partnering with Lady Gaga on a specially themed package of the Oreos based on the pop star’s latest album, “Chromatica.”
The cookies are “pink-colored Golden Oreo cookies with green-colored creme,” said the company, and will feature designs inspired by the album on the wafer.
The new Oreos will be available in six-cookie packs starting in January, while full packs of the Chromatica cookies will arrive next year.
Fans who want the cookies early can sign up for the Lady Gaga x OREO Stan Club to get notified when the full packs release. Oreo says the first 1,000 subscribers will get a free pack of cookies.
Oreo and Lady Gaga are also launching a contest, “Sing it With Oreo,” kicking off Dec. 15, where winners can receive free merchandise and experiences featuring the pop singer.
