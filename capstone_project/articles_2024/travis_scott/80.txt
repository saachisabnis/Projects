Kevin Parker may be best known for his musical work under Tame Impala and producing for other artists like Lady Gaga, Dua Lipa, Travis Scott and Ye–but the musician is also behind a new tech company called Telepathic Instruments. The company’s first product to be released is The Orchid, a portable “idea machine” for musicians and producers of all levels to explore melodic compositions with a digital polysynthesizer.
The company co-founded with partners Ignacio Germade, Chris Adams, Charl Laubscher and Tom Cosm has tapped Stefan Stenzel to help design the synth, which includes five stylistic modes:  Strum, Slop, Arpeggiator, Pattern and Harp. A wide range of chord voices can be re-pitched and re-positioned along a full keyboard scale, while reverb, chorus, and delay can add additional sonic textures.
The Loop feature makes the machine useful for fleshing out ideas and arrangements, which can ultimately be transferred to the user’s production software via a MIDI cable.
See the video below for a demo of The Orchid’s capabilities.
