Drake fired off some fake gunshots at a Travis Scott prop during a recent show.
In video footage circulating online on Monday (April 1), Drake is seen doing the action at the end of his collab with Travis, “Meltdown.”
It’s unclear why Drake decided to shoot the fake fire shots at the Travis prop, but fans have assumed that it could be due to Travis requesting at Rolling Loud L.A. that Future and Metro Boomin play their song “Like That” with Kendrick Lamar, which features a diss towards Drake.
Future and Metro played the song, but cut it off before the record got to the Drake slander.
