Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker know they're endgame and even talk about how they are going to grow old together.
A source told People that the Poosh founder has "much more of an inner peace" since she started dating Barker in January 2021, adding that the blink-182 drummer treats her "like a queen." He even recently honored his "amazing wife" while celebrating her 45th birthday, calling her his "soulmate" and "best friend forever." 
"She enjoys a lot of family time and work very much comes second," the source. "She seems calmer, much happier and content with life. Travis is amazing. He treats Kourtney like a queen. They talk about growing old together — it's very cute!"
Kardashian and Barker began dating in January 2021 and tied the knot in a lavish Italian wedding ceremony in 2022, after saying "I do" in both a non-legal Las Vegas wedding and a small-but-official courthouse ceremony. They have since welcomed their first child together, a son named Rocky Thirteen born in November 2023.
Baby Rocky joins the couple's blended family of Kardashian's children Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9, whom she shares with ex Scott Disick, and Travis' kids with ex-wife Shanna Moakler, Landon, 20, Alabama, 18, and Atiana De La Hoya, 25.
"Although they're a mixed family, everything works and is very intentional. Kourtney and Travis are doing a great job keeping all the kids happy. They make special time for all of them," the source said, adding that Rocky has been "an amazing addition to the family." "He's making everyone happy. Kourtney loves seeing Travis with the baby."
