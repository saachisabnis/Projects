Teezo Touchdown’s highly-anticipated debut album How Do You Sleep At Night? dropped in September. Immediately upon its release, the rising rapper skyrocketed to celebrity status, earning co-signs from heavy hitters such as Drake, who referred to the project as “some of the best music ever.”
Since then, Touchdown has collaborated with Travis Scott on his UTOPIA album, as well as with Grand Marnier and 1017 ALYX 9SM. He also announced his first headlining tour, kicking off in Amsterdam in March, and just this recently, was named Apple Music’s Artist Up Next for January 2024.
Touchdown has now shared that he’ll be putting out a deluxe version of his debut album. The extended project is called How Do You Sleep At Night? With You? and will arrive on Wednesday, January 10.
The artist – who eclectically blends pop, punk and rap – hasn’t shared specifics when it comes to the forthcoming release. After working with Janelle Monáe and Fousheé on the original LP, it’ll be interesting to see what other unexpected collaborators he may tap for the deluxe.
