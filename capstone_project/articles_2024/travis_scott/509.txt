Last year’s edition of Longitude took place at Marlay Park between July 1 and 2, and was headlined by Calvin Harris and Travis Scott. The festival also featured the likes of Anne-Marie, Raye, Ice Spice, Lil Uzi Vert, Metro Boomin, Joey Bada$$, Glorilla, FLO, and more. Since its inception in 2013, the festival has also hosted acts including Tyler, The Creator, Dave, Stormzy, Future, Cardi B, A$AP Rocky, Lil Baby and JPEGMAFIA.
Longitude Festival’s UK-based sister event, Latitude Festival, has also recently announced its 2024 lineup, which will feature headliners Duran Duran, Kasabian, Keane and London Grammar, alongside a stacked lineup including Nile Rodgers & Chic, The Darkness, Future Islands, Lankum, The Vaccines, Khruangbin, Orbital, Corinne Bailey Rae, Jockstrap and more. The event will take place between July 25 and 28 at Suffolk’s Henham Park.
Last year’s edition of Latitude Festival, which was headlined by Pulp, Paolo Nutini and George Ezra, was awarded a four-star review by NME, with Max Pilley highlighting the festival lineup’s nostalgic tone. On Pulp’s headlining set, he wrote: “These first shows the band have played in eleven years have been brimming with nostalgic goodwill, and as they tear through classics from their iconic ‘Different Class’, multiple generations rejoice together.”
