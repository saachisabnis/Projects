Travis Scott is considered ahead of the curve in the rap game, but he was recently proven to have been part of the Caitlin Clark fan club long before most were on board.
NBA trainer Chris Brickley took to Instagram on Saturday (April 6) and offered receipts on Cactus Jack’s work as an amateur scout.

He shared a screenshot of his own Tweet, which itself screenshotted a text from Travis Scott.
“Man, Caitlin Clark has had a great college career but NOBODY was on her b4 my brodie @trvisXX [checkered flag emoji],” Brickley’s tweet read. “This was a text from March 24th, 2021 [two red exclamation emojis].”

The text from Travis read: “Caitlin Clark [six brain exploding emojis].”
Brickley posted the screenshot before Iowa’s basketball game agains UCONN, which the lady Hawkeyes won on April 5, 71-69.

The caption read: “I’ve seen people calling @travisscott a bandwagon @caitlinclark22 fan. Well in 2021, he was the first person to ever text me or bring her up to me. He’s really been a day 1 Caitlin Clark Fan. Also S/O my Brodie for his new college apparel line with @lids @fanatics & @mitchellandness [two red exclamation emojis]. It’s too fire!!!”
He concluded: “I’m def a big @caitlinclark22 fan and I’m excited to get in the gym with her but I’m also a big @paigebueckers fan, we’ve been grinding for years!!! TONIGHT GONNA BE A GREAT ONE!!”
Travis Scott isn’t the only Hip Hop figure who’s been paying attention to Caitlin Clark.
Earlier this week, Lil Durk upped the ante on Ice Cube‘s BIG3 proposal to Caitlin Clark, promising to double the N.W.A legend’s already sizeable offer.

The Chicago MC took to X (formerly Twitter) to declare his desire to lure the Iowa Hawkeyes star to the three-on-three league.
In response to a post about Cube’s initial $5 million offer to Clark, Durk wrote: “I got 10 million come play with my 3.”

The “All My Life” hitmaker had earlier shared his thoughts on the player’s performance in Iowa’s 94-87 win over LSU to reach the Final Four of the NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament.
Caitlin, who recently became the NCAA’s all-time scoring leader, put up a typically dazzling display in which she posted 41 points, 12 assist and seven rebounds.

“Omg Clark,” Durk simply wrote.
Though Durk doesn’t currently operate a team in Ice Cube’s BIG3 league, his tweets certainly imply interest in becoming a coach.
