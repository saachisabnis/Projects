Cash Cobain and J. Cole join forces for the former’s newest single, “Grippy.”
Clocking in at almost four minutes, the latest track is an updated version of the rising NYC star’s hit 2023 song “Dunk Contest.” Cobain shines through and through as he elevates his subtle yet catchy signature sound, while Cole’s early presence on the cut hears him settle in with the track’s jumpy sonic space. “Grippy” arrives shortly after his link up with Ice Spice on the remix of “Fisherrr,” and it sounds like the young artist is more than ready to spread the word of Slizzy.
Just last month, the sample drill originator took to the streets of Union Square with his loyal legion of fans to perform a makeshift show following the unfortunate cancellation of his Slizzy Fest birthday performance. With the arrival of “Fisherrr” and “Grippy,” fans are now looking forward to his upcoming work with the likes of Travis Scott, Don Toliver, Lil Yachty and, hopefully, Frank Ocean.
