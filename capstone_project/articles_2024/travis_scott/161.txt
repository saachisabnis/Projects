Selena Gomez has spilled the beans about what she was whispering to Taylor Swift at the Golden Globes. Rumours were flying that Gomez and Swift were chatting about Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner, who were at their first awards show together.
But now, Gomez has spoken her mind. Posting on Instagram, she said: "Noooooo I told Taylor about two of my friends who hooked up. Not that that's anyone business."
This came after a short video clip where Gomez whispers something to Swift and Keleigh Sperry, actress Miles Teller's wife, had everyone guessing online. In the clip, you see Gomez sharing some news, and both Swift and Sperry look shocked.
Gomez was up for an award for best female actor in a TV comedy or musical for Only Murders In The Building but sadly didn't win. Swift also missed out on an award, for the Eras Tour concert film.
Chalamet and Jenner have been dating since April 2023, following Jenner's split from rapper Travis Scott, who is father to her kids Stormi, five, and one year old Aire Webster.
They made their first public appearance together in September, when they attended Beyonce's Renaissance tour in Los Angeles. The couple was spotted enjoying the concert in the city of stars.
