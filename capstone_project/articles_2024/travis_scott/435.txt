The Philadelphia Flyers defeated the Ottawa Senators, 4-2 at Wells Fargo Center on Saturday evening. Coming off a loss in Washington the previous night, the Flyers put forth a determined effort against the Senators.
¬†
Even strength and penalty shot goals by Tyson Foerster late in the second period put the Flyers in the driver's seat. Philly also got a deflection goal from Joel Farabee and an empty net tally from Cam York. Vladimir Tarasenko and Thomas Chabot scored for Ottawa in a losing cause.
The Flyers (32-23-7) finished 1-2-0 in their season series with Ottawa. The Senators (25-21-3) made things tough on the Flyers as Saturday's game progressed.
¬†
Playing his first NHL game since the regular season finale last year, Felix Sandstr√∂m stepped up to deliver 24 saves on 26 shots, including several timely and difficult stops. He got a bit of help, too, from his goal posts and from 28 blocked shots in front of him.
¬†
The Flyers peppered Ottawa goalie Mads Sogaard with 39 shots. He made 36 saves. Sogaard's best work came in the first period, keeping his team in the game.
¬†
The Flyers dominated the first period, outshooting and outchancing the Senators by a huge margin. Philly took a quick lead and had three power play chances -- with a lot of pressure and two high-end scoring chances on the second power play -- but couldn't add to their lead. The Flyers forechecked well and had sticks in the lanes when Ottawa attempted to attack.
¬†
Breaking a 14-game goal drought, Farabee (18th goal of the season) deflected a Nick Seeler point shot into the net for a 1-0 lead at 1:08 of the first period. Seeler received the lone assist.

Ottawa tied the game at 1-1 on a backhander to the short side by Tarasenko (17th of season) from the right wing at 4:04 of the second period. The assists went to Shane Pinto and Mathieu Joseph.
¬†
A two-goal surge in the final minute of the middle stanza catapulted the Flyers ahead 4-2 by the second intermission. Prior to that, most of the period was fairly evenly played with a slight edge to Ottawa.
At 19:13, Scott Laughton won an offensive circle faceoff back to Tyson Foerster (15th goal of the season), who fired a shot from the top of the circle off a Senator and past Mads Sogaard for a 2-1 lead.

Foerster, at 19:58.5, was hooked on a breakaway by Pinto and awarded a penalty shot. The sequence started with a fine defensive play by Foerster. On the ensuing penalty shot attempt, Foerster moved in patiently and beat Sogaard low to the glove side for his second goal of the game (16th) overall to expand the lead to 3-1. Foerster's penalty shot goal was the fifth by the Flyers this season: a new NHL record.

¬†
Cam York scored an empty net goal from the neutral zone to nail down the win in the final second of the game.
