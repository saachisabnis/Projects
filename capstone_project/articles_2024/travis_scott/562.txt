With the broadcasting rights to Super Bowl 58, CBS is taking full advantage of all its assets.
Ahead of the game on Sunday evening, the network unveiled a new version of the iconic David Glen Eisley's "Sweet Victory" from the 2001 SpongeBob SquarePants episode "Band Geeks".
In the episode, SpongeBob and friends perform at a battle of the bands during the so-called "Bubble Bowl."
This isn't the first time the song has been incorporated into the Super Bowl. In 2019, it was used to introduce rapper Travis Scott during the halftime show. However, this time, CBS used the full song while interspersing crowd shots, players from the game and more than a few jellyfish.
It's meant to market the Nickelodeon broadcast of the game, which has been tabbed as "Super Bowl LVIII Live from Bikini Bottom." The song will also be played to open the broadcast.
While it's going to be all business on the field between the Chiefs and the 49ers, it's clear CBS is trying to lean into some silliness, as well.
