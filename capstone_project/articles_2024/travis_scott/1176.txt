Rapper and college sports fan Travis Scott recently announced a new line of merchandise featuring various universities across the country.
Scott has recently been seen at the University of Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball games as Caitlin Clark and squad take down opponents in the NCAA Tournament.
Out of the 28 schools that are a part of the line, Scott included the Oregon Ducks.
Oregon fans can buy two different t-shirts, sweatpants, a sweatshirt, and a hat to represent their Ducks throughout the year.

Scott created his merchandise line and recording company, Cactus Jack, in 2017. It has featured various tour merch and most notably produced Scott’s ‘Utopia’ album in 2023.
While this isn't the usual Nike gear that fans have grown so accustomed to, it would make for really cool additions to the game day rotation.
Cactus Jack and the Ducks have one thing in common – which fans should keep in mind as the rapper’s college line releases – and that’s Nike.
Scott and Cactus Jack have released various Nike shoes in collaboration with Oregon’s unsung 12th man thanks to founder Phil Knight. Over the years, there have been 20 Cactus Jack x Nike shoes.

Scott recently visited the University of Texas where he had a pop-up shop for his new college march line, which also includes the Longhorns. He had a meet-and-greet at Darrell K. Royal Stadium and mingled with many of Texas’ star athletes.
Maybe one day, Scott and his new line will make an appearance in Eugene to meet with some of the Ducks. At least he can be told it never rains in Autzen.
