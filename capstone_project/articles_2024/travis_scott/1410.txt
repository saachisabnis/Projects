During a party at the Cannes Film Festival, rapper Travis Scott apparently got into a fight with Cher‘s boyfriend, Alexander “AE” Edwards. Scott and Edwards were both attending nightclub owner Richie Akiva’s “THE AFTER” party on Thursday night, May 23, along with Cher, Tyga, Future, Odell Beckham Jr., Joe Jonas, and other high profile guests. Attendees got up throughout the party to guest DJ, and the fight took place when Tyga and Scott were both on stage behind the DJ booth, according to reports by Entertainment Tonight. Scott and Edwards are seen trading punches in videos from the scene. It remains unclear about who started the altercation and what initiated the fight. Both Scott and Tyga have been romantically linked to Kylie Jenner, with Scott sharing a daughter and son with Jenner. (People)
