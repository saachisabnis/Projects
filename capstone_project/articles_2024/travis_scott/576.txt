Call it a belated birthday gift.
Taylor Swift showed up to support Travis Kelce at the Kansas City Chiefs’ game against the New Orleans Saints on Monday, two days after the tight end turned 35.
The “Down Bad” songstress wore head-to-toe Vivienne Westwood, rocking a draped plaid corset ($1,875) and matching miniskirt ($1,010) with the brand’s knee-high Grace platform boots ($1,270) and heart-shaped Belle bag ($590) as she arrived with her dad, Scott.
Swift wore Vivienne Westwood earrings ($177) along with pieces by Jacquie Aiche, Effy Jewelry and Shahla Karimi — plus her favorite vintage Cartier necklace.
A sprinkling of Fazit glitter freckles ($16) and her signature red lipstick finished things off.
Swift often incorporates Chiefs colors, Kelce’s jersey number and other team tributes into her game-day outfits.
Most recently, she attended Kelce’s Sept. 15 game against the Cincinnati Bengals wearing an oversized vintage Chiefs T-shirt as a minidress — a piece she’d procured from local Kansas City shop Westside Storey, her go-to for vintage team merch.
Her sideline style has also included bespoke jersey jackets, his-and-hers friendship bracelets and even a Santa hat embroidered with an “87.”
Kelce, who’s been dating Swift since summer 2023, assured Page Six ahead of Monday’s game that his girlfriend would be in attendance.
“I know she’s coming in,” the NFL player shared during his Kelce Car Jam charity event in Kansas City on Saturday.
He also spilled his dream birthday gift, telling us, “I’ll take another Super Bowl if you got one of those.”
