The second round of the NBA Playoffs rages on with all four of its series having a team win at least one game so far. On top of this, the basketball action is heating up even more with tonight serving as the WNBA’s season opener, including a regular season debut performance from Caitlin Clark. In anticipation of this, plenty of court-ready sneakers are dropping alongside the usual slate of high-powered collaborations and exciting in-line launches. PUMA, Reebok, New Balance, Nike, adidas and Jordan Brand are all involved in this week’s sneaker action. However, before we give you the rundown of this week’s best drops, let’s go ahead and review what went down on the news side of things last week.
Nike took advantage of the excitement surrounding the new WNBA season by announcing that A’ja Wilson has her first signature shoe on the way. It also had an early image of Sabrina Ionescu’s Nike Sabrina 2 leak — revealing a design reminiscent of the Kobe 5. From there, Tim Cook collaborated with the Swoosh to flex a 1-of-1 pair of Nike Air Max 1 ’86s in celebration of the new iPad Pro and Apple Pencil Pro being revealed. First looks at the VERDY x Nike SB Dunk Low “Vick” and Travis Scott x Nike Shark-A-Don “Sail” also hit the net.
As for the Jumpman team, it also had a Travis Scott project in the news as the latest stories from the rumor mill included word of a Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP “Velvet Brown.” Another rumor to surface mentioned a Nigel Sylvester x Air Jordan 4 “Firewood Orange” arriving in 2025. After months of discussion, a first look at the Air Jordan 1 “Black Toe Reimagined” revealed its special collar detailing.
Elsewhere in the footwear industry, adidas had a first look at its latest Wales Bonner x adidas Samba project surface, this time combining on the adidas Samba Millennium. New Balance kept up its momentum with the 1000 silhouette as a new “Angora Moonrock” caught the eyes of many sneakerheads. Crocs rounded out the week with teasers of two new Quick Trail Low colorways and Salehe Bembury’s Crocs Pollex Juniper in “Realtree Camo.”
With all of the past week’s key headlines reviewed, let’s go ahead and dive into what to expect from the sneaker space this week on the drops side of things. Once you review this week’s best ten releases, be sure to hit up HBX to shop styles that are available to purchase now.
