Travis Scott is ready to release new music. During Lyrical Lemonade’s Summer Smash, the Utopia rapper hinted at the release of Jackboys II.
“We [have] been thinking about doing a Jackboys II,” he told the crowd in Illinois.
This year, Travis Scott and company will celebrate the five-year anniversary of the first Jackboys compilation. Released on December 27, 2019, the project debuted at number one with 154,000 units in its first week. The project included contributions from several stars, including Lil’ Baby, Rosalía, Don Toliver, Young Thug, Quavo, Offset and the late, great Pop Smoke.
Since the release of Jackboys, Cactus Jack Records has remained active, releasing new projects from the label’s founder and Don Toliver. SoFaygo and WondaGurl have also been added to the label’s roster.
At the moment, there’s no word as to when or if Jackboys II will come to life, but it appears fans are already on board.
“We will be there,” one fan wrote.
“I hope so,” another fan added.
While fans wait for the next Jackboys project, Cactus Jack Records will turn to Don Toliver’s latest album, Hardstone Pyscho, released on Friday, June 14. The 16-track project features Future, Kodak Black, Teezo Touchdown, Metro Boomin’ and the label’s founder, Travis Scott.
