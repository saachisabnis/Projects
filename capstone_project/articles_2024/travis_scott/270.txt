21 Savage received quite the gift from his “twin” Travis Scott for his recent birthday.
Taking to his Instagram Story following his 32nd year around the sun on Tuesday (October 22), 21 showed off the Audemars Piguet watch that La Flame gifted him. The Royal Oak Double Balance Wheel Openworked edition of the AP retails for a starting price of $76.4k – so it’s safe to say that the pair must really have a close relationship.

In other news, 21 Savage recently received what is quickly becoming an annual honor: his own day in Georgia’s DeKalb County, this time to celebrate a back to school drive he put on with his foundation.

The event provided K-12 students with school supplies, backpacks, uniforms, and more.
“I might rap about a lot of stuff, but that’s just a reflection of what I’ve been through,” 21 told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the event. “In real life, everything I do, I want to bring everybody together. I want to give back to the community, help the kids, get them uniforms, books, book bags, everything they need…just do better. That’s where it starts, the kids.”
