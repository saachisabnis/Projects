The headliners for Coachella 2025 will be Lady Gaga, Green Day, Post Malone (who already confirmed his appearance in his Big Ass Stadium Tour announcement on Tuesday), and Travis Scott. Other artists on the bill include Charli XCX, FKA twigs, Missy Elliott, Megan Thee Stallion, Kraftwerk, The Prodigy, The Misfits, The Go-Go’s, Three 6 Mafia, Jimmy Eat World, and dozens more. 
This will be Lady Gaga’s second time headlining Coachella, after she stepped in to replace a pregnant Beyoncé in 2017. Green Day, who have made frequent festival appearances over the years, have surprisingly never played Coachella. However, frontman Billie Joe Armstrong joined the Replacements during their 2014 festival set. Post Malone performed in Coachella’s Sahara Tent in 2018 and has made numerous guest appearances in the past, but this will mark his first time headlining the festival. Travis Scott was tapped to headline Coachella 2020 before it was canceled due to the pandemic. The rapper was scheduled again in 2022, but was removed from the lineup following the 2021 crowd stampede at his Astroworld Festival, which resulted in the death of 10 people. (Consequence of Sound)
