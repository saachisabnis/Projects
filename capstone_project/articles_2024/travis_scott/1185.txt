Even Taylor Swift can’t get over boyfriend Travis Kelce’s surprise Eras Tour performance Sunday.
“I’m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav’s Eras Tour debut 🥰 Never going to forget these shows,” the singer, 34, captioned various photos and videos from “round one” at Wembley Stadium in London.
She went on to gush that her three shows in the UK were “so surreal.”
“Looking out into crowds of 90,000 fans each night and hearing that VOLUME… Those were some of the loudest crowds I’ve ever heard. Acoustic sections went OFF.”
Swift noted she “got to sing ‘Castles Crumbling’ with @yelyahwilliams for the first time” and that her “heart was just so full of love for her and [their] friendship.”
“Then the impossibly gifted and wonderful @gracieabrams came and surprised the crowd with the first performance of our song ‘us,'” she added, going on to say that she “can’t wait to do it 5 more times in August. Up next: Dublin!! 🇮🇪.”
During her third concert at Wembley Stadium, the songstress brought the NFL star onstage while performing a skit for the “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” transition.
The audience erupted in cheers when they saw Kelce, also 34, approach his girlfriend and pick her up from a pretend faint.
The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, who wore a black suit with a matching top hat for the sketch, seemingly whispered something to Swift as she dangled from his arms while donning a long white dress.
Kelce then carried her to a red couch at the center of the stage before setting her down and fanning her alongside two backup dancers.
Eventually, the Grammy winner popped up and took off her gown, revealing a white sparkling bralette and high-waisted bottoms.
The football player fanned himself with his hands while motioning Swift to perform her hit song from her “The Tortured Poets Department” album.
While the pop star managed to stay in character for the act, Kelce couldn’t wipe the smile from his face.
The athlete supported Swift at all three of her London shows and was spotted alongside her parents, Andrea Swift and Scott Swift, earlier in the evening.
The trio sat in the VIP section of the arena alongside Sophie Turner, Paul McCartney and other A-listers.
After Kelce joined Swift onstage, fans became convinced that her new ring featuring a duo of diamond-dotted Ts was “deffo an Easter egg for the TTPD set.”
Following the concert, the couple enjoyed a date night at Chiltern Firehouse, after which photographers caught them holding hands as they left the hotel early Monday morning.
On Friday, Kelce attended Swift’s show with his brother, Jason Kelce, and even ran into Prince William and the royal’s three kids.
