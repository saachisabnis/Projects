While Taylor Swift was absent for Travis Kelce’s 35th birthday celebration with pals on Saturday night, we hear she held an intimate celebration for her football beau on Sunday. 
A source tells Page Six that Swift and her father, Scott, took the tight end and his family — along with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes — out to sushi hotspot Noka.
The source tells us it was an intimate affair and it was a very early night since the Kansas City Chiefs played the New Orleans Saints the next day.
The restaurant had no comment.
The restaurant — which serves up rolls and entrees like miso cod and dry aged duck — is closed on Sundays but is available for private events.
But the private party may all be apocryphal because another source said they didn’t think Swift was in town before Monday!
According to Instagram gossip site DeuxMoi, the couple had previously dined at the local hot spot late last month, when they closed their doors, saying they were doing maintenance.
A tipster told the social media site it is also where Brittany held her birthday.
Swift attended Kelce’s game on Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium, watching his team win from a VIP suite with her father and teammate Mecole Hardman Jr.’s fiancée, Chariah Gordo. 
The high-powered couple then celebrated the win by cuddling up at an after-party at an undisclosed location. 
On Saturday, Travis celebrated his birthday with his brother, Jason Kelce, and his wife, Kylie, and pal Mahomes at Zac Townsend’s comedy show at the Midland Theater in Kansas City — where the group went backstage.
Earlier that day, Kelce hosted his annual Kelce Car Jam charity event and shared with Page Six what he wanted for his birthday this year.
“I’ll take another Super Bowl if you got one of those,” he said.
Swift had not attended Kelce’s previous two games — with a source telling Page Six she has been in rehearsals to resume her tour in Miami on Oct. 18.
