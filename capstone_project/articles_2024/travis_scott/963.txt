Drake isn't back against Kendrick Lamar or anyone else who's been targeting him in their music. A reference track to the actual diss made it's way around social media on Saturday afternoon, April 13. However, the real version of Drake's diss track "Push Ups" has officially surfaced. The new version has a more upbeat tempo and has Drake firing back at K. Dot, Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross, J. Cole, The Weeknd and his XO crew. Drake decided to use an actual image of Kendrick doing push-ups as the official artwork, which iHeartRadio is exclusively debuting today. 
"'Cause Top told you drop and give me fifty like some push-ups, huh," Drake raps. "Your last one bricked, you really not on s**t/They make excuses for you 'cause they hate to see me lit, Pull your contract 'cause we gotta see the split/The way you doin' splits, b***h, your pants might rip/You better do that motherf**kin' show inside the bitty/Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty, Then we need a verse for the Swifties/Top say drop, you better drop and give 'em fifty." There's a lot to process in Drake's lengthy response to Kendrick Lamar. Not only does Drizzy claim K. Dot is being outsold by other artists like Travis Scott, 21 Savage and his former labelmate SZA, but he also accuses Top Dawg Ent of extorting Kendrick by making him cough up 50 percent of his earnings. He also appears to drag Lamar's wife Whitney into their drama with a slick line that references Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard. Drake also takes on Future's scattered jabs on his two recent albums and literally tells Metro Boomin to shut up and make drums. Meanwhile, The Weeknd and his XO crew, including Cash XO and Nav, catch several strays midway through the verse. "Claim the 6ix, and you boys ain't even come from it," Drake spits. "And when you boys got rich, you had to run from it/Cash blowin' Abel bread, out here trickin' (Out here trickin')/S**t we do for b***hes he doin' for n****s."  Drake wants smoke for Rick Ross and J. Cole too. He mentions both artists towards the end of the verse right before the beat switches up. That's when Drizzy seems to taunt Lamar and anyone else who wants to step up to him.
