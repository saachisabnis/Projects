A little bit of shuffling for the Vikings
The Minnesota Vikings have shuffled some of the players on their practice squad, so let’s get everyone updated on those moves here.
The team has announced that they have signed defensive lineman Jonathan Harris and offensive tackle Leroy Watson to the practice squad. To make room for them, the team has announced that they have waived cornerback Kelvin Joseph and offensive tackle Coy Cronk.
Harris has been in the NFL since 2019, when he signed with the Chicago Bears as an undrafted free agent out of Lindenwood University. He appeared in two games for them in 2019 before being waived and signing with the Denver Broncos. During the 2020 preseason, Harris was waived by the Broncos with a non-football injury designation and spent the year in reserve after clearing waivers.
He then came back and played three more seasons for the Broncos, appearing in 28 games over that stretch with nine starts. He signed with the Miami Dolphins ahead of the 2024 season but was waived and placed on the practice squad. The Carolina Panthers then signed him and he appeared in seven games for them before being waived on 23 December.
Watson has been in the league since 2022 when he signed with the Atlanta Falcons after going undrafted out of Texas-San Antonio. He was a tight end in college but moved to offensive tackle upon getting to the NFL. After going through camp with the Falcons and being waived as part of their final cuts, he spent 2022 on the San Francisco 49ers practice squad.
He was back on the Niners’ practice squad in 2023 but was eventually signed away by the Cleveland Browns, playing in seven games for them at right tackle. He was then traded to the Tennessee Titans in April of 2024 for a seventh-round pick and, after being waived again and re-signed to Tennessee’s practice squad, started four games for them at right tackle this season.
With these two changes, the Vikings’ practice squad is now comprised of the following players:
If the Vikings make any more changes to the practice squad, we will let you know when they happen.
