An amusing logo mixup is bridging the worlds of fast food and sneakers as some people happen to mistake the Air Jordan wings logo for the Wingstop logo.
The account @resellingsecrets recently posted a carousel to Instagram featuring two instances in which the chicken wing company and Nike imprint were confused. The mixup is understandable — while they are not exactly the same, both logos feature a pair of wings with a circle in the middle, in addition to a curved banner bearing the brands’ names.

This is not the first time the mixup has entered the cultural conversation. A post went viral on Twitter/X in 2021 after a user said her mother thought her brother’s green Air Jordans were “wingstop shoes.” Inspired by the joke, Wingstop made a foray into the footwear business with the creation of the Lemon Pepper 1s — a sneaker developed with Shoe Surgeon and made possible to win by joining Wingstop’s fan club and engaging with the company on social media. Inspired by the chain restaurant’s colors, the shoes were green and white and featured chicken-inspired brown fuzzy Swoosh.

While Jordans are most closely associated with the Jumpman logo, the wings logo dates back to the 1980s when it debuted on the Air Jordan 1 during Michael Jordan’s rookie season in the NBA. Peter Moore, who designed the Air Jordan 1, came up with the logo when he saw a child on a plane with a pair of plastic wings gifted by a flight attendant. While the Jumpman became more popular in the long run, the original wings image lives on as Nike holds onto its heritage. For example, Travis Scott’s new Air Jordan 1 Low OG “Medium Olive” sneaker can be seen below.
