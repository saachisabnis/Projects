	Some of the marquee schools on board include the University of Michigan, University of Miami, University of Kentucky, University of Alabama, Penn State University, University of Texas, Clemson University, Florida State University and many more. 

	Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin added on Instagram of the partnership: “This is major! My guy @travisscott and @cactusjack teamed up with @fanatics @mitchellandness @lids for the ‘Jack Goes Back to College’ limited edition collection!! Such a unique collab – fusing our university partnerships with Trav’s incredible vision and Cactus Jack’s high-end signature streetwear to give sports fans something they’ve never seen before. Can’t wait for launch on 4.4 on fanatics.com.”

	Back in February 2022, Rubin’s Fanatics acquired Mitchell & Ness in a landmark deal that featured Jay-Z, Meek Mill, Lil Baby and the D’Amelio family as partners to complete the purchase of the lifestyle brand.

	“Fashion is cyclical, but classics are forever,” Jay-Z said in a statement at the time. “Mitchell & Ness is a true classic. I was an early adopter of this brand, as well as a part of a departure from athletic wear. I’m proud to play a small role in bringing it back, and in some cases, introducing the authenticity and quality of the Mitchell & Ness brand to a new generation.”

	Look for the Cactus Jack capsule to arrive ahead of the NCAA’s March Madness Final Four on April 4. Find the full list of schools participating in the Jack Goes Back to School collection below.
