Grayville leaders spent an hour in executive session Monday night.  Council was only in open session for a total of 23 minutes with no major news coming out of the gathering.  Mayor Travis Thompson says the reason for the lengthy closed door discussion was primarily collective negotiations with the union.
The municipality is sitting on about $3.2 million in assets between restricted accounts, investments, and cash available for operations.  Council heard updates from both Scott Irvine, the Grayville Utility Manager and Engineer Rex Gower of Milano & Grunloh.  He discussed the Phase 2 Water Main replacement, the Albion/Grayville Water Treatment Plant, the unsuccessful OSLAD application, among other topics.
Street Commissioner Chris James made a motion to approve the 2024 Motor Fuel Tax Program.  It includes $71,700.  $52,704 for oil and chipping, $5,860 for blacktop, $5,280 for salt, and $1,360 for concrete.  It was approved unanimously.
The next scheduled Grayville City Council meeting is set for April 8th  at 7.  A public hearing for the annual budget is scheduled to precede that meeting at 6:45pm.
