Travis Kelce failed to impress fans with his outfit as he arrivedÂ at Arrowhead Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs' matchup against the New Orleans Saints on Monday.
The athlete, 34, was supported by superstar girlfriend Taylor Swift, 34, who wowed fans in a Vivienne Westwood off-the-shoulder tartan corset and matching miniskirt, paired with knee-high black leather platform boots.Â 
But despite the fact that Travis matched the Karma singer in aÂ plaid shirt, he was blasted for looking 'a mess.'
Kelce strolled into the stadium around two hours before kickoff, and paired his oversized short-sleeve shirt with large cream shorts and sunglasses.
He sported a mustache and a hairstyle that was tapered in the back and sides and long on top.Â

'ok so can taylorâ€™s outfit eat bc travis looks a mess,' one fan wrote.Â 
'He dressed liked the mighty ducks kids when they wasn't on the ice,' another added. 'Looks like a middle school version of Kelce,' someone else chimed in.Â 
'He looks like rocky from the mighty morphine power Rangers.'
'Looks like me in 5th grade,' yet another Twitter user added.Â 
'Walking into the first day of middle school like . . . .'
Some thought the outfit had a vintage vibe to it, writing that Kelce was 'looking like a bully straight out of 1996.'Â 
'He looks like middle school students when they leave school early to hit the mall lol.'
Yet another person quipped that Travis was the 'Mark Wahlberg of the NFL.'
'Acting this way at 35 years old is embarrassing,' another person wrote underneath an ESPN video of the athlete making his way to the locker room.Â 
Others took issue with his haircut, with one person writing, 'He needs to get a new haircut,' and another adding, 'Might be the worst haircut in the history of haircuts.'
Last month fans brutally mocked Kelce's 'terrible' new haircut for Chiefs' season opener, saying the 'barber did him dirty.'

Taylor made her hugely anticipated return to Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on boyfriend Travis, after missing his birthday on Saturday and the last two Kansas City Chiefs games.
Swift made it to the opening two games of the season in Kansas City but then missed the road games at Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Chargers.
She has been enjoying a break from her Eras Tour, which starts up again next week in Miami, meaning her absence from Kelce's games was a surprise over the last fortnight.
But she took her seat in the stands, alongside her father Scott, to cheer Kelce on as he bids to lead the Chiefs to a 5-0 start in their pursuit of an historic third straight Super Bowl title. She even had red face glitter on in a subtle show of support for the Chiefs.
Her appearance also silenced fears that the couple may have split after a leaked 'contract' emerged online claiming that they were going to break up in late September.
The document, apparently printed on the headed paper of his US PR company circulated online, Mr Kelce called in the lawyers - and yet, though the break up announcement never materialized, the public hadn't seen them out together since the date listed on the piece of paper.
They were last seen together in New York for the US Open men's final, where they were joined by Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany.
It was also the first time that Swift and Brittany had been seen together since Mahomes publicly backed Donald Trump ahead of the upcoming election - a view at odds with Swift's political allegiance. She has since publicly backed Kamala Harris.
Swift was missing as Kelce celebrated his 35th birthday on Saturday by hosting his charity 'Car Jam' event in Kansas City, raising money for his 87 and Running foundation.

Kelce has made a stuttering start to the season for the Chiefs but signaled that he is on his way back to his best form in last weekend's hard-fought 17-10 win against the Chargers
But he was caught on camera telling attendees that he anticipated Swift being at the game on Monday to cheer him on against New Orleans Saints.
The tight end at least got to celebrate with his nearest and dearest, with the entire Kelce clan in attendance, including mom Donna, dad Ed, his brother Jason, and Jason's wife Kylie.
Speculation about Taylor heading to Kansas City had swirled all week with a rumor circling about her hiring out a popular barbecue joint Wednesday night for a pre-birthday celebration.
There were no confirmed sightings of the Bad Blood singer, however, who has made considerable efforts to mask her flight details and whereabouts since the foiled terror attack at her Vienna concert in August.
Kelce has made a stuttering start to the season for the Chiefs but signaled that he is on his way back to his best form in last weekend's hard-fought 17-10 win against the Chargers.
He recorded 89 yards with seven receptions in the game - more than he had managed in his first three games combined.
