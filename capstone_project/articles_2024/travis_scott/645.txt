On Wednesday, September 18, Kid Cudi took to X, formerly Twitter, to give Pusha T a heartfelt shoutout. The “Day N’ Nite” hitmaker credits King Push as the “only real friend” he had on G.O.O.D. Music. Cudi, Pusha, and Big Sean were some of the first acts to sign to Ye’s label after he found superstardom with his first three albums. 
Kid Cudi has credited Ye as a mentor but recently shared that his strongest relationship on G.O.O.D. Music was with Pusha T. Cudi tweeted: “Push has been my closest homie since day 1,” he tweeted. “He embraced me from jump and always had my back. When I was on G.O.O.D. Music, he was literally the only one I had a true relationship with. That’s my big bro, and I love him forever. We’re definitely going to keep putting out heat for y’all.”
Push has been my closest homie since day 1.  He embraced me from jump and always has my back.  When I was on GOOD music, he was like literally the only one I had a true relationship with.  Thats my big bro and I love him forever.   We def gon keep puttin out heat for yall 😉 https://t.co/olZq4VbxXk
His words suggest a bond that transcends the often volatile world of music industry friendships. It’s no secret Kid Cudi has conflicted with other G.O.O.D. Music artists, including Ye and Big Sean. Big Sean discussed his issues with Kid Cudi and wishes to amend on the song “No More Interviews.” 
Addressing beef with Cudi, Sean raps: “So many friends turn to enemies, they frenemies / I don’t know why I act like I’m surprised or it’s offending me / I’m saying, though, I should have learned from Hov and Dame / From Stunna and Wayne, Cudi and YE / What happened to our family ways, though? / When I put you on that song with Nas, you had told me that you was forever grateful / And that we brothers, so it hurt to hit the internet to find out that me and you don’t fuck with each other / Over a miscommunication that probably could be fixed with a 5-minute conversation, I’m still praying.” 
Although Pusha has never had a public issue with Big Sean, he has had a falling out with Ye, formerly Kanye West, over politics throughout their friendship. Pusha left G.O.O.D. Music in 2022 after becoming president in 2015. 
Under G.O.O.D. Music, Pusha and Cudi created compilation albums and endured beefs together. Drake mentioned the two of them on his 2016 diss track “Two Birds, One Stone.” Cudder and Drake would eventually make amends and collaborate on music together while the beef with Drake and Pusha continues. 
Cudi’s shoutout to Pusha follows last month’s announcement that The Scotts, a joint album between Travis Scott and Kid Cudi, won’t be released. In this week’s release, Kid Cudi collaborated with Chip Tha Rapper on a new song entitled “Don’t Worry”.
