Rapper Kid Cudi was performing late in his set at Coachella on Sunday when he lept off the stage. The rap star injured himself after he landed awkwardly and was forced to cut his performance short.  
Kid Cudi took to X to discuss what happened. “Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show. 🤦🏾‍♂️ just leavin the hospital,” Cudi wrote. “Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big 🥹.” 
Cudi’s set at the Sahara Tent was a late addition to the lineup for the second weekend of the festival in Indio, California. The performance marked his first at Coachella since 2019. 
The 40-year-old musician was performing his song “Memories” when the unfortunate incident happened. Fan-shot footage shows Kid Cudi taking a hard fall. He was attended to by festival staff and carted off to the hospital.
