Tom Brady was spotted at Fanatics Fest at NYC’s Javits Center on Thursday before the sports extravaganza even began.
The retired Super Bowl champ was seen having a ball — literally — shooting basketballs, as well as hockey pucks, hitting baseballs and walloping a punching bag as the sports confab was being set up, including all its various skills challenges for fans.
Page Six previously reported that the weekend extravaganza from Fanatics and its founder Michael Rubin from Aug.16-18 is expected to bring out up to 100,000 attendees — plus stars including Brady, Mike Tyson, Derek Jeter, Kevin Durant, Ben Stiller and more.
Jay-Z will also attend, we reported, to launch a limited edition reboot of his 40/40 Club that will only be available to a very select group of VIPs.
Rubin also announced on Thursday that the best dressed suprerfan at the fest will get tickets to the Super Bowl, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup, World Series, Wrestlemania, a massive UFC fight and the MLS championship.
More fans will also be chosen to do a meet and greet with their favorite athletes.
Also appearing at Fanatics Fest will be Eli and Peyton Manning, Travis Scott, Spike Lee, Jerry Rice, Kevin Garnett, Roger Goodell, Adam Silver, Reggie Jackson, Julius Erving, Jake Paul, Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, Pete Alonso, Mike Richter, Kareen Adbul-Jabar, Allen Iverson and more.
Rubin previously told The Post of the event: “There’s not another company that could pull this off because they don’t have the relationships with athletes in different businesses and leagues.”
