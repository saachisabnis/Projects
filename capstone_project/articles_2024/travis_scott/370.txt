Elizabeth Ann Fuller, known affectionately as Libby, was a pillar of love, dedication, and warmth in the lives of her family and friends. She peacefully passed away on May 28, 2024, at Hendrick Hospice Care in Abilene, leaving behind a legacy of kindness and cherished memories.
Libby’s journey began on October 19, 1949, in her hometown of Coleman, Texas. She was a woman of many talents and passions which she lovingly shared with those around her. Libby’s bright personality shone through in everything she did, from creating beautiful quilts to tending to her flourishing garden. Her skillful hands were always busy with sewing projects and delectable dishes for her loved ones.
Graduating from Coleman High School in 1968, Libby embarked on a lifelong journey of caring for her family. She married Roy Rhoads on June 21, 1968, a union that brought joy and fulfillment into her life. Years later, she found love once again and married Bobby Fuller in 2005 in Elm Valley.
In the tapestry of Libby’s life, family gatherings were woven with love and laughter. Holidays and birthdays became cherished traditions thanks to her dedication to creating memorable events that brought everyone closer together. Her devotion extended beyond human companionship as she held a special place in her heart for her beloved pets.
Among those who had the privilege of being part of Libby’s life are her surviving family members who will carry her memory forward with love and admiration. Her loving husband, Bobby Fuller of Coleman; son Travis Rhoads and partner Ashley Barns of Coleman; daughter Amy Flippin of Coleman; stepchildren Blake Fuller and wife Kelly of Abilene, and Hunter Fuller of Abilene; grandchildren Jordan Rhoads and wife Harley, Mason Burkey, Kenley Castleberry and husband Kayden, Cye Barns, Colson Barns; great-grandchildren Harlan Rhoads and Essie Rhoads; siblings Patti Scott and husband Bill of San Angelo, Tony Berry and wife Lea of El Paso; along with her cherished dog companion Rhett Butler.
While we mourn the loss of Libby from our earthly presence, we find solace in knowing that her spirit lives on through the lives she touched so deeply. Her kind gestures, warm smile, and unwavering love will forever remain etched in our hearts.
