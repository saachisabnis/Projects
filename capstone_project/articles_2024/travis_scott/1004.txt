Kourtney Kardashian‘s only daughter, Penelope Disick, 11, is all grown up in her latest TikTok video with her mom and brother, Reign Disick, 9. In the post, shared on February 8, P sang along to Jhené Aiko‘s hit “Stay Ready” and even got the 44-year-old and her brother to join in on the fun. For the fun TikTok, the 11-year-old rocked a black Blink-182 t-shirt that featured a butterfly along with denim pants.
Penelope completed her casual look with a black jacket and what appeared to be pink acrylic nails. Kourt’s mini-me flashed her chic manicure throughout the lip-syncing video as she used her hands to add to her performance. P also tied her brunette tresses up and back into a low ponytail. Meanwhile, Reign looked just as stylish in a pair of black shorts and a black Kaws crewneck sweater. The nine-year-old even glammed up the look with a gold chain necklace.
