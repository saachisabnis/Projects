50 Cent is set to make millions from his first-ever residency in Las Vegas. According to a report TMZ published on Tuesday, October 15, the seasoned rapper has secured a deal worth $15 million for a string of shows at the PH Live inside Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. His appropriately-titled residency "50 Cent: In Da Club" is expected to feature a mix of new and classic hits including "21 Questions," "Candy Shop" and, of course, "In Da Club." Fif will hit the stage at six scheduled shows beginning December 27 including an exclusive New Year's Eve event presented by the artist's liquor brand Sire Spirits. 
50 Cent knows how to pack out a venue full of fans. He spent most of 2023 traveling the world for his "Final Lap Tour" with supporting acts Busta Rhymes and Jeremih in celebration of the 20th anniversary of his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin'. After the tour kicked off in July, the G-Unit founder performed at 83 shows in North America, Europe, parts of Asia and Oceania. He brought out plenty of guests throughout his run in the U.S. including YG, Tyga, and his close friend Eminem. The tour officially wrapped up in December 2023. His "Final Lap Tour" earned $103.6 million with over 1.05 million tickets sold. It was the third rap tour to cross the $100 million threshold along with Drake's "It's All A Blur Tour," Kendrick Lamar's "Big Steppers Tour," Travis Scott's "Circus Maximus Tour" and Nicki Minaj's "Pink Friday 2 World Tour." Tickets for 50 Cent's first Las Vegas residency go on sale this Saturday, October 19. For more information, visit PH Live's official website here.
