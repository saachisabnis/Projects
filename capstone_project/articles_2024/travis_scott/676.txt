Kylie Jenner has opened up once again about battling postpartum depression, which she says played a major role in changing her son’s name twice before ultimately settling on Aire.
In the September issue of British Vogue, the 27-year-old makeup mogul reveals that while her fans already know she changed her son’s name once, she actually did it again — and “felt like such a failure” for taking a year to make the choice.
“My son’s name was actually Knight for a long time,” she said of now-2-year-old Aire, who was originally named Wolf. “My daughter, still to this day, is like, ‘Do you remember when Aire’s name was Knight? … I like Knight better.’”
Jenner shares both Aire and daughter Stormi, 6, and with ex-boyfriend rapper Travis Scott.
Of the back and forth on her son’s name, Jenner said the “major baby blues” she suffered attributed to her inability to make a decision.
“With my son … I was just so emotional over things that I probably wouldn’t be that emotional about [typically],” she recalled. “On the phone with my mom all day hysterically crying, saying, ‘I can’t figure out his name.’”
“I felt like such a failure that I couldn’t name him,” Jenner continued. “He deserved so much more than that. It just really triggered me.”
In March 2022, a month after welcoming the little boy, Jenner announced he was no longer named Wolf, though she didn’t immediately say what he would be called going forward.
It wasn’t until June of 2023, 16 months after his birth, that Jenner revealed her son’s name had been legally changed to Aire.
“Now my advice to all my friends having children is pick the name before,” she concluded. “Because when the hormones hit you can’t make decisions. You can’t.”
