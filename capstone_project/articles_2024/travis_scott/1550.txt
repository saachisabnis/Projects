When Instagram blog Our Generation Music shared a clip of the moment to their page, Quavo popped in the comments with eye emojis and a rocket, getting fans even more excited.
It’s currently unclear if the track is for a solo project from the Atlanta rapper, or the previously-teased sequel to the 2017 collaborative album, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho.
In September, Quavo incited excitement when he took to Instagram to respond to a thread that celebrated Travis Scott’s achievements and subtly suggested the possibility of an imminent release.
“That’s tuff next one loading….. battery up,” he wrote, accompanied by a full battery emoji.

In late 2017, Quavo and Scott partnered up for the release of Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho. Commercially, the project was well-received, debuting at #3. It beat out Eminem’s Revival, which sat in the #4 spot.
Collecting 89,775 total album equivalent units (16,561 in pure albums and a streaming count of 105,321,887), the album, which boasted features from fellow Migos members Offset and the late Takeoff,  as well as production from Murda Beatz, Southside, Buddah Bless, and Cardo, was dubbed an overall success.

While watching the Hawks beat the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday (January 30), the pair were spotted filming with a camera man by a fan across from them.
