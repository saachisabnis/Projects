	Spring break looks a little different if you are in the Kardashian family. Instead of hitting up a public library or local playground — or maybe taking a road trip to the beach — you could join the family on a scenic getaway to Turks and Caicos! Kim Kardashian posted stunning new photos of her family vacation with sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian, and they’ll make your jaw drop.

	










	“Spring Break,” the SKIMS founder captioned a new photo carousel on Instagram Monday. The first picture features her daughter North, 10, wearing her long curly hair in two pigtails and smiling at the camera as her cousin True rides piggyback on her back. The little girl, who turns 6 this week, is all smiles with her hair in braids with white thread.

	She also shared pictures of her kids on the beach. Kim’s son Psalm, who turns 5 next week, wears a lifejacket as he wades around in the water looking so grown up! The water is crystal clear, the sand is practically white, and the sky is deep blue — it looks like pure paradise.



	She also shares photos of Psalm, Chicago, 6, and Saint, 8, on a boat. It looks unbelievable!

	Khloé also shared photos from the vacay, including several with True and Chicago playing together in the ocean and Tatum, 20 months, watching them on the sand. He also included a video of Tatum tiptoeing in the water as the girls giggle and splash around. The sun is setting in the background, and everything just looks so amazing.

	“🩵” the Good American founder captioned the photo. Kourtney commented, “memories to cherish forever 🩵” So, so sweet!

	Paris Hilton commented, “😍.” Someone else noticed, “His little footprints in the sand 😍.”

	She also shared a picture on her Instagram story of True in an orange swimsuit, holding sand while she stands in the water.

	Today, Kourtney shared more pictures of the vacation, including one with 5-month-old baby Rocky’s foot! “💭☀️🥭🐠🌅,” she captioned the photos, one of which shows Rocky sitting on her lap, with his little toesies reaching out toward the ocean.



	In another, she showed a picture of the beach after the kids had been playing, which was dotted with shovels, pails, and other sand toys.
