The stars were out Friday night for the first of Taylor Swift’s four shows in Sydney, Australia.
Fans took note of Academy Award winner Taika Waititi’s appearance, along with singers Katy Perry and Rita Ora.
But the most noteworthy celebrity concertgoer was Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. He’s dating Swift, of course, and her fans were just a tad excited to see him when he arrived at Accor Stadium.
Kelce got to the venue with his friend and former Chiefs teammate Ross Travis and Swift’s father, Scott.
At one point, Kelce walked through part of the crowd and he was met by screaming fans.
Kelce later did his best to get the Swifties hyped for the show, and fans once again screamed their approval.
When the show started, Kelce was clearly proud of Swift.
Oh, and it appears to be official: Swift once again changed the lyrics to the song “Karma” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs!”
That wasn’t the only time Swift acknowledged Kelce, who less than two weeks ago helped the Chiefs win the Super Bowl. She pointed at him when she sang, “I was your favorite.”
And when Swift crooned“you gave us our trophies,” she was speaking for all of Chiefs Kingdom and pointed to Kelce.
But it seemed that fans swooned the most when she sang “That’s my man” and acknowledged Kelce.
Kelce was waiting when Swift left the stage and the two kissed and walked away together.
Rain and hail originally was in the forecast for the show, but that apparently wasn’t an issue as Kelce and the rest of Swift’s fans clearly enjoyed the concert.
