A few days ahead of Hardstone Psycho‘s worldwide release, Don Toliver has unleashed the official tracklist and featured artists for the project. As revealed in an Instagram post with more thematic visuals, the anticipated offering is equipped with features from Travis Scott, Teezo Touchdown, Future and others.
Totaling 16 tracks, the album also sees contributions from Kodak Black on “Brother Stone” as well as Cash Cobain and Charlie Wilson on the already-released “Attention.”
The rapper revealed the news in the below Instagram carousel, which also features some alternate album art and an iron insignia that Don’s referring to as “The Psycho Iron.”

Hardstone Psycho’s tracklist also features the already released singles “Bandit” – which officially signaled his return – as well as “Deep In The Water,” which revealed he and Kali Uchis had had their baby.
United by a cohesive aesthetic – which includes lots of chains, bikes and leather garments – Donny upped the ante on Hardstone Psycho‘s rather lowkey rollout, ensuring all of the album’s visual components remain elevated, cohesive and almost mysterious, as most arrive drenched in shades of gray and blue.
Keep an eye out for Hardstone Psycho, which drops everywhere this Friday, June 14.
