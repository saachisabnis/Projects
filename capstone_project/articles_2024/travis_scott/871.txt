Travis Scott was arrested and taken to the Miami-Dade County Jail on Thursday morning at 4:35 am, as reported by sources such as CNN. The circumstances surrounding Scott's arrest are still largely unknown, but it is confirmed that he was charged with trespassing and disorderly intoxication. The 33-year-old is expected to face charges for these offenses. A $650 bond was posted, but it is uncertain whether Scott is still in custody. The incident occurred about four hours ago, so more details are forthcoming. Scott's mugshot has surfaced online, depicting his displeasure with the situation. This is not Scott's first brush with the law; he was previously arrested for "inciting a riot" at a concert and was recently investigated for his involvement in the Astroworld Festival tragedy, although he was cleared of charges.
