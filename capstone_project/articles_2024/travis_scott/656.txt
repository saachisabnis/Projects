With college football season close to wrapping up, Pat McAfee is looking forward to making his WWE return.
Paul “Triple H” Levesque reiterated this week that McAfee will be returning to WWE commentary when Raw’s Netflix era starts in January 2025. WWE and Netflix held a media event at Netflix headquarters on Tuesday celebrating their new partnership. Levesque said McAfee and Michael Cole will be calling Raw together weekly.
“An absolute honor to be asked back,” McAfee tweeted last night. “A Childhood dream realized every single time I’m lucky enough to be in an arena with the @WWE Universe.
“Can’t wait to be talking into a microphone next to @MichaelCole again.. He’s the [greatest of all time] I’m excited to tell the worldwide audience on Netflix how great the WWE Superstars are…. and how big of scumbags some of ‘em are too. Let’s go”
Raw’s Netflix premiere is taking place from the Los Angeles area on January 6 at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood. John Cena, Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, CM Punk, Bianca Belair, and rapper Travis Scott are being advertised for the show, along with “many other Superstars and surprise guests.”
McAfee joined ESPN’s College GameDay in 2022, which has caused him to take a break from his WWE role during college football season. The former NFL player also hosts The Pat McAfee Show on ESPN every weekday.
