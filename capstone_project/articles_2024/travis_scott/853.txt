At Variety’s Hitmakers Brunch on Dec. 7, Quavo was recognized as ‘Humanitarian of the Year’ during the event at Nya Studios in Hollywood. Reports highlight that the GRAMMY-nominated rapper has become a leading advocate against gun violence, a cause he took on following the devastating loss of his nephew and Migos collaborator, Takeoff, in 2022. 
Greg Jackson, Deputy Director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, highlighted Quavo’s relentless efforts to tackle the crisis through his Rocket Foundation. Launched in November 2022 in memory of Takeoff, the foundation has swiftly become a significant force for change, supporting community-led initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. 
Quavo’s work has resonated across both local and national levels. In March, his Rocket Foundation introduced the Sparks Grants, distributing $10,000 each to ten Atlanta-based organizations focused on fostering safer communities. Over the summer, he teamed up with the offender Alumni Association to conduct a music education workshop for at-risk youth through the Rocket Camp initiative. 
On a national level, Quavo’s efforts were pivotal in the creation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. 
During the September 2023 Congressional Black Caucus legislative conference, Quavo engaged with Vice President Kamala Harris. 
Earlier this year, he organized the inaugural Rocket Foundation Summit in Atlanta, addressing gun violence and supporting the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—an unprecedented federal gun control law in U.S. history. The Rocket Foundation collaborates with groups like the Offender Alumni Association, H.O.P.E. Hustlers, Community Justice Action Fund, LIVE FREE, aiming to combat gun violence through community-led initiatives. 
Beyond his philanthropy, Quavo continues to be a major presence in the music entertainment worlds. As a core member of Migos, he earned multiple chart-topping hits on the Billboard charts and collaborated with artists like Justin Bieber, Travis Scott, and Post Malone. 
Recently, Quavo has ventured into solo work, teaming up with artists such as Lana Del Rey, Peso Pluma, and Lenny Kravitz to demonstrate his genre-blending talents while maintaining his deep ties to Atlanta’s music scene. His versatility also shines through in his acting roles, with appearances on shows like Atlanta and Black-ish, as well as in films such as Praise This.
