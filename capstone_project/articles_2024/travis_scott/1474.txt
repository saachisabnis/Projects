Another day, another Travis Scott grail.
After teasing the Shark-A-Don just a few weeks ago, the mega-hyped Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG ‘Medium Olive’ is now officially official. This is a sneaker that's been in the works since the very beginning of the year. And while it's exactly what you'd expect from the American rapper, that's exactly why it's gonna sell out in just seconds.

Marking the Utopia artist's eighth (!) take on this legendary Air Jordan silhouette, just like 2022's ‘Reverse Mocha’ and 2023's ‘Olive,’ this trainer has an earthy palette that's ideal for autumn. Working on top of a ‘Medium Olive’ suede base, it's overlaid by panels and panels of ‘Sail’ leather throughout. La Flame's signature backwards Swoosh is stitched onto the lateral sidewalls in black (similar to the golf shoe that he dropped last year), and his Cactus Jack logo is seen on the left heel in a spicy red shade.

Down below, the midsole is infused with Nike's Air tech for extra comfort and bounce. And just like the Texas-born artist's other AJ1s, it's decked out in a pre-aged finished for an archival vibe. Oh, and the shoes also come with two extra pairs of laces, which is always nice.

As well as the ‘Medium Olive,’ rumour has it that Travis Scott will be releasing even more Jordans over the next few months, including the ‘Pink Pack,’ the ‘Velvet Brown,’ and a follow-up to the Fragment Design collab from three years ago. Y'know, the pair that Ben Affleck just won't stop flexing. So if you're a big fan of his sneakers, your bank account's about to be in a whole world of pain.
The Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG ‘Medium Olive’ is set to release on September 28 at Nike, the Snkrs app, and select stockists worldwide for £145.
