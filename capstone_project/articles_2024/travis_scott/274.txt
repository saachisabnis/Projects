Kid Cudi is canceling his upcoming Insano: Engage the Rage World Tour after finding out his broken ankle  is “much more serious” than he thought. 
“Guys, so, I have a broken calcaneus,” Cudi posted Wednesday on social media. “Im headed to surgery now and there’s gonna be a long recovery time. We have to cancel the tour so I can focus on getting better to be out there in top shape to rage with you all.”

Kid Cudi offers an update on the ankle he broke jumping off the Sahara stage on the last day of Coachella 2024. He seems upbeat, albeit a little uncertain.
The calcaneus is more commonly known as the heel bone. While some ankle fractures can heal in weeks, a broken calcaneus has a longer recovery time. “This type of fracture commonly occurs during a high-energy event — such as a car crash or a fall from a ladder — when the heel is crushed under the weight of the body,” the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons says on its website. Surgery is often required to prevent heel deformity. 
This, friends, is why you don’t jump off one of the tallest stages at Coachella.
“There’s just no way I can bounce back in time to give 100%,” Cudi said. “The injury is much more serious than I thought.”
The U.S. leg of the Insano tour was supposed to start June 28 in Austin, Texas, and conclude with a show in Los Angeles  on Aug. 30. Kid Cudi planned to head to Europe in early 2025; it’s unclear whether that part of the tour is still on.

A judge removes Drake, who performed with Travis Scott at the 2021 Astroworld concert, from a suit filed by families of the 10 fans who died in a crowd crush.
The rapper said  that ticket holders will be contacted by email and receive a full refund. Also, new tour dates will be announced as soon as possible. 
In a video posted earlier this week and captured by TMZ, Kid Cudi said with a chuckle, “This is what happens when a 40-year-old man tries to prance around offstage like he’s 26, like he used to do back in the day.” He added that he was “hoping” to be healed up in time to hit the road.
So much for that idea. 
“I’m so sorry fam and I love you all so much, thanks for the endless love and support. Im really disappointed as im sure you guys are too, but I will be back. Thats a promise,” the rapper wrote Wednesday. 
“Im ok, just a lil soreness, but im in good spirits.”
