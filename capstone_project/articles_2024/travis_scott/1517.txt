Ye could be working on new material as he tells Digital Nas he’s going into his “art studio mode.”
A series of text messages shared by the producer teases the possibility of Ye dropping a new single as the two of them share unreleased music with each other. They repeatedly refer to a track in an unseen portion of the text messages as “insane,” and Digital Nas further suggests to Ye that he should release a single through “the label system” as it’s already mixed and mastered. West is a little apprehensive about the process, however, replying that he would prefer to give the responsibility of releasing it to someone else as he’s “going into my full Ye art studio mode.”
Digital Nas posted the text messages just shortly after Ye shared a preview of an unreleased track on Instagram entitled “PREACHER MAN,” and many fans were quick to celebrate his stellar soul chop work. Other artists also jumped into the comments section of the post, including the likes of Travis Scott, Ty Dolla $ign, Steve Lacy, Channel Tres and more.
