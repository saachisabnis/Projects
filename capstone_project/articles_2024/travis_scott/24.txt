On Dec. 23, 2024, hip-hop sensation Lil Baby made headlines with a shocking revelation about his struggles with gambling addiction. In a candid discussion on Lil Yachty’s “A Safe Place Podcast,” the Atlanta rapper disclosed that he lost an astonishing $9 million in just 40 hours due to his gambling habits.
During the podcast, Lil Baby recounted his harrowing experience, stating, “I made myself stop gambling.” He explained that his addiction reached such a critical point that he sought help from Mike Rubin, the owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and Fanatics, to have himself banned from all casinos. This drastic measure was a testament to the severity of his gambling issues.
When asked by Yachty about the largest amount he had lost in a single session, Lil Baby responded, “Eight million dollars. One day, probably like 40 hours. Forty hours straight, I lost, like, $8 million, $9 million.” His admission highlights the often-hidden struggles that many face with gambling addiction, a topic that resonates with many in the Black community.
As expected, Lil Baby’s revelation drew reactions from fellow artists. Notably, 50 Cent took to social media to share his thoughts, humorously comparing Lil Baby’s gambling losses to those of his former friend and boxing champion Floyd Mayweather. 50 Cent’s post read, “Nah these young 🥷🏾 crazy 8 million Gambling. I thought only Floyd do s— like that. LOL, come out of the joint looking distraught. I’m just glad he didn’t kill nobody.” This playful jab underscores the camaraderie and banter that often exists within the hip-hop community.
Despite his struggles, Lil Baby remains focused on his music career. He announced that he has a new project set to release at the beginning of 2025, titled WHAM (Who Hard As Me). The album is scheduled to drop on Jan. 3, 2025, and will feature collaborations with several prominent artists, including Young Thug, Future, 21 Savage, GloRilla, Rod Wave and Travis Scott. This upcoming release is highly anticipated and is expected to showcase Lil Baby’s growth as an artist, both personally and professionally.
Lil Baby’s candidness about his gambling addiction is crucial in raising awareness about this often-overlooked issue. Gambling addiction can have devastating effects on individuals and their families, leading to financial ruin, strained relationships and mental health challenges. By sharing his story, Lil Baby not only highlights the risks associated with gambling but also encourages others who may be struggling to seek help.
