During Travis Scott’s tour stop in Miami on Sunday, the rapper noticed a janitor cleaning up around the Kaseya Center and stopped the show to address the man from the stage. “Today, you’re gonna be off,” the rapper said. “Somebody get my guy $5,000. I want you to just take off the day. I just seen you come out the back, I don’t know who the fu-k told you to go get a mop. Only way he clocking in is only if he can rage.” Scott then launched into “Fein” and the crowd went wild. He’s been doing good deeds a lot on the Circus Maximus tour, which wraps up this week.
