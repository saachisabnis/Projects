People from all across the country flocked to Eastern Iowa to see five of the team's seniors play at Carver-Hawkeye Arena for the last time.
I don't know about you, but I had no clue Travis Scott was a fan of Iowa sports.
The performer was spotted hanging around the arena and interacting with Coach Lisa Bluder and stopping to take a photo with the players after the game. Scott posted it on his Instagram story.
When worlds collide...
Travis Scott has become one of the biggest names in the rap game right now. He's a Houston native and has collaborated with artists like Beyoncé, SZA, and Bon Iver.
The record-producer has had four #1s and fifteen top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. Travis Scott is probably most well-known for his 2018 album 'Astroworld.'
If you are a fan of reality television, you might even recognize him as the baby daddy of 'Keeping Up with the Kardashian' reality star Kylie Jenner.
While he's blown up in the music world, he gained some mainstream attention outside of the genre in 2021.
On November 5th, 2021 tens of thousands of fans flocked to Houston, Texas for the Astroworld Music Festival. Ten fans died at the festival due to poor crowd control.
The crowd surged toward the stage and crushed multiple fans, according to reports.
Astroworld is widely considered one of the most disastrous music festivals in America.
