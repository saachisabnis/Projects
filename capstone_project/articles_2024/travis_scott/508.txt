The Detroit Pistons have teamed up with Royce Da 5’9 to unveil a six-piece apparel collection honoring the legendary producer J Dilla. The limited-edition collection includes a t-shirt, two hats and the hoodies featuring original artwork commemorating J Dilla’s sophomore LP, Donuts, and honoring the city he grew up in. Each piece will be exclusively available at Pistons313Shop.com or Little Caesars Arena in Detroit on March 13 as the Pistons welcome the Toronto Raptors to town.
“When designing the capsule for the J. Dilla Pistons partnership, our aim was to honor Dilla’s essence,” Royce 5’9 said.
“Our interpretation of the iconic Donuts album cover was pivotal to the collection, as the album holds significant historical importance within hip-hop circles.”
From Travis Scott pulling up to a college basketball game in Des Moines to Fat Joe recruiting LeBron James for a pick-up game in New York, Hip-Hop and basketball have always been tied together. Detroit has embraced these cultural intersections through limited-edition releases honoring J Dilla and collaborating with Big Sean.
“I grew up in the city, which naturally made me a fan of the Bad Boys. I would later have a Grant Hill poster on my wall and then, against all odds, would watch the ’04 Pistons go on to win the Championship, inspiring the whole city of Detroit,” Big Sean said after being named the team’s Creative Director in 2020.
“I look forward to creatively finding new ways to contribute to their legacy and continue their dedication to the community through sports, art, and, of course, music.”
Big Sean, Royce Da 5’9, J Dilla and the list goes on. Check out the latest collaboration between Detroit’s iconic Hip-Hop scene and the Pistons.
