Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are rockstar parents. 
In fact, the duo recently posed for a sweet picture with their 8-month-old son Rocky in a post shared on Travis' daughter Alabama Barker's Instagram Story June 25. 
In the photo, Kourtney, wearing an oversized black hoodie with flames on the arms, cuddles her baby boy as Travis poses alongside them in a hoodie adorned with skeletons, as he holds his phone and hugs a pillow under his arms. 
The duo pouted at the camera while aboard what appears to be a plane, as Alabama, 18, had location stamped a photo of a private jet earlier that day in Houston, Texas to her Instagram Stories. 
Alabama lovingly captioned the snap of the couple, "My favorite people," adding a heart hands emoji. 
Kourtney and Travis have been amid a busy time with their blended family, which includes the Poosh founder's kids Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9, with ex Scott Disick as well as the Blink 182 drummer and ex-wife Shanna Moakler's kids Atiana De La Hoya, 25, and Landon, 20, as well as Alabama and Rocky.
Travis is currently on tour with his band, which played shows in San Antonio and Fort Worth, Texas, this week. The eldest Kardashian sister has been able to partially support her husband amid her other commitments, even sharing a video from Travis' June 25 performance to her Instagram Story, writing, "Never gets old."
"Our children are so lucky to have you," Travis wrote in a Mother's Day Instagram tribute. "Thank you for filling our home with love, laughter and joy."
And the Kardashians star, who wed the musician in 2022, is equally as grateful to her husband. 
"Beyond grateful for the Dad that you are to our baby boy, and all of our kids," Kourtney wrote for Father's Day on Instagram. "You keep us safe and protected and take care of us. Having a family with you is heaven."
