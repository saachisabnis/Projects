Justice x Miguel – “Saturnine”

Justice enlists Miguel for their latest single “Saturnine,” which is set to appear on the album Hyperdrama (out April 26). “We don’t think we’ve ever made anything that sounds remotely like this track before,” state the band of the song’s epic scope,” the duo shares in a statement. “It started with Gaspard playing around with an E-mu synthesiser guitar sound, and he found the main riff. The rest came very quickly. We love Miguel’s voice when it’s raw. We wanted him to sound outrageously frontal, with no space around his voice. We felt confident we could make this work with a single mono take of his voice, and minimal processing. It also suited the theme of the song, that’s this sort of fear and loathing in Las Vegas sweaty, hallucinatory flow. Feeling well in feeling bad.”
