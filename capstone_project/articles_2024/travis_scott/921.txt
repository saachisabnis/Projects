Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz was pilloried by many on the right Saturday after he declared at a rally in Pennsylvania that Americans could not afford “four more years” of the issues facing them — a comment that prompted many to point out who has been in the White House during that time.
Walz was speaking at a rally in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on Saturday when he made the remarks. The candidate had been talking about guns and school shootings, attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance for trying to “make it about the Second Amendment.” 
As he was saying that Democrats believe in the American people and their ability to solve problems, and that Republicans do not, he paused to point out someone in the crowd in need of water.
As he resumed his remarks, Walz said their Republican opponents just “want to instill fear” while Vice President Kamala Harris believes “it doesn’t have to be this way.”
She simply has said it doesn’t have to be this way. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can’t afford we can’t afford four more years of this. And I’ve been saying it.
He then moved on to talking about Project 2025. 
Republicans, including  Donald Trump Jr., former Gov. Scott Walker, and popular satire site The Babylon Bee, quickly pointed out who has been in power for the current four year period that, according to Walz, we can’t afford more of.
