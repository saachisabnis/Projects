	Released in 2014, Days Before Rodeo was Scott’s second mixtape, setting the stage for his debut album Rodeo in 2015.

	 The mixtape featured standout tracks like “Mamacita,” featuring Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug, and “Don’t Play,” featuring Big Sean and The 1975. The tracks, along with production from Metro Boomin, Lex Luger, and Travis Scott himself, introduced a moody, atmospheric style that has since become a hallmark of the trap genre.

	The release comes following following Scott dropping the music video for “Drugs You Should Try It” more than a decade after its original 2014 release.

	La Flame released the trippy “Drugs You Should Try It” visual on Aug. 18 after DBR came to streaming services on Aug. 23. The clip kicks off with an homage to Virgil Abloh, who designed the neon-lit smoking cowboy sign that makes an appearance. Scott starts free-falling into a pool of despair and allows his mind to drift into the depths of his conscious.

	Scott’s chart success includes his sophomore album Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, which topped the Billboard 200, and the Astroworld album, which spent three weeks at No. 1. His hit single “Sicko Mode” became a staple on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 1, while his collaborations with artists like Drake and Young Thug have secured multiple top 10 hits
