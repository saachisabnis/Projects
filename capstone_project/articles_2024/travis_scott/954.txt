OKLAHOMA CITY — Epic Charter Schools’ longtime former chief financial officer took the stand Friday to testify against the school’s co-founders in the state’s massive racketeering and embezzlement case against all three men.
In initial questioning by a prosecutor, Josh Brock, 42, revealed that he had signed a tentative agreement to accept a felony conviction with a suspended sentence of 15 years’ probation and restitution in exchange for his truthful testimony.
Also charged in a case described as the “largest abuse of taxpayer funds in the history of this state” are Epic co-founders David Chaney, 44, and Ben Harris, 48.
Mid-morning on the fifth day of the preliminary hearing, Brock was called as a witness and described how he and other acquaintances of Harris and Chaney were recruited into Epic’s operation — and then how many of them got access to money or business for themselves or their relatives.
Epic Youth Services, Harris and Chaney’s private company that was contracted to manage the school during its first decade, made all three men wealthy.
But Brock said that was achieved by extensive lobbying to dodge accountability for school spending and by relying on Oklahoma taxpayer-funded school employees, computers and facilities for work the private company EYS was paid to do.
“Minimize cost, maximize profit,” Brock said of the arrangements, which he said were by the design of Chaney, Harris and himself.
When Epic’s student enrollment surged to 60,000 because the global COVID-19 pandemic sent parents clamoring for home-based learning options for their children, Brock said his annual compensation peaked at $1.5 million to $2 million, most of which was from his 10% of EYS profit-sharing.
Brock said Harris and Chaney’s profits that peak year totaled $20 million.
All week, Chaney’s and Harris’ defense attorneys have contended that much of the taxpayer monies their clients are accused of misappropriating had actually become “private funds” once they were received into EYS’ bank account.
In the early years of Epic’s operation, Brock recalled Harris once saying of the student Learning Fund in a discussion among the trio: “Anything left over could be used for retirement purposes if we were divorced from the school.”
But state law enforcement contends that Epic’s student Learning Fund was Oklahoma taxpayer funding intended only for the education of public school students enrolled in Epic Charter Schools in Oklahoma.
Three years removed from the date the school’s governing board cut all ties with EYS, and nearly two years since Chaney, Harris and Brock found themselves slapped with criminal charges under the Oklahoma Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, Brock said his perspective on the Epic student Learning Fund has changed.
“It was for the benefit of the students,” he said on the witness stand Friday, as his wife and father watched from the courtroom’s gallery for more than five hours.
Brock’s testimony is not concluded. The next court dates for the preliminary hearing have been set for May 7 and 8.
The pending criminal case alleges 15 counts, including embezzlement, money laundering, computer crimes and conspiracy to defraud the state.
Early questions by prosecutors sought to establish Brock’s role in the founding of the school in 2011 and the fiscal operations of both the school and Epic Youth Services, because Brock served as CFO for both.
He described that arrangement of working on both sides of payments — creating invoices for EYS and then turning around and paying them for the school “void of internal controls.”
Brock said he became acquainted with Harris in the early 2000s through a mutual friend named Travis Burkett. Over the years, Harris reportedly shared his ideas for creating a charter school, and then he recruited Brock away from his job at a bank to become the school’s and EYS’ CFO.
Brock said it was initially a lateral move salary-wise, because he was paid a monthly fee as a contractor of EYS identical to his previous salary — $7,333.33.
But the deal was sweetened in other ways.
On top of profit-sharing in EYS that grew by multitudes along with Epic’s student enrollment through 2021, Brock said he was paid additional bonuses ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 for balancing the school’s annual budget, for timely reporting to the state and for receiving “clean” annual audit reports for the school’s balance sheets.
And those “clean” annual audit reports were completed by someone who was no stranger to Brock.
Brock said he personally selected Chuck Crooks at the firm CBEW to serve as Epic’s independent auditor because they were personally acquainted from their mutual hometown of Cushing.
As Epic’s student enrollment and state and federal funding grew, Crooks’ fees for those annual audits increased from $5,000 a year to $30,000 a year, Brock said.
In the early years, Brock said he was also paid to do basic accounting work for IAQS, a company doing business as Filter Tec, in which Brock said Harris had ownership and Chaney then served as general manager.
Earlier witnesses testified that IAQS credit cards were among the private credit cards used for all Epic student Learning Fund purchases for things such as educational materials.
Prosecutor Jimmy Harmon, who serves as chief of the Criminal Division for the Office of the Oklahoma Attorney General, said Chaney and Harris exerted total control over the school by selecting friends and acquaintances for the school’s governing board. He asked Brock numerous questions to find out what he knew about the details of those connections.
Harmon asked how many times he recalled the board voting against their proposals.
“Very few,” Brock responded.
Brock said Greg Scott, brother of longtime board Chair Doug Scott — who in testimony earlier in the week identified himself as a childhood friend of Chaney’s and Harris’ in the town of Newkirk — was given “tens of thousands of dollars” in work for software.
The Tulsa World previously reported that those familial ties were never made public when Epic’s just overhauled school board in the spring of 2021 inked an agreement to send Greg Scott’s company $2.5 million for software licensing amid the school’s divorce from Chaney and Harris.
Of Bobby Stem, who served as chair of Epic’s school governing board from 2011-14, Brock said that on the same day Stem resigned from the school board, he became a contract lobbyist for EYS through a company called Capital Gains and went on to do lobbying for EYS and the school for many years.
Brock said Stem’s original retainer fee was $5,000 per month but that it later increased to $7,000 per month.
When the prosecutor asked whether he would be surprised to know that Stem was paid $520,000 total, Brock responded no.
In testimony earlier in the week, Doug Scott said a board member named Liberty Mitchell was just an Epic graduate with no ties to Chaney or Harris.
But Brock’s testimony differed.
Brock said Harris and Chaney knew Liberty Mitchell’s father, Scott Mitchell, a political analyst for News 9 in Oklahoma City and News on 6 in Tulsa, who hosts “Your Vote Counts.” Brock said Scott Mitchell requested and received donations totaling an estimated $5,000 to $10,000 from EYS and free office space inside Epic’s school administration building.
“There were some payments (from EYS) issued to Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Mitchell had a desk inside the school and would come and go and do some things,” Brock said. “He would ask for donations related to different activities he had.”
Brock said that when Burkett, the mutual friend who introduced him to Harris, was an early member of the school’s governing board, he would request donations from EYS to his foundation and received $5,000 to $10,000 total.
During questioning, Brock said Harris and Chaney engaged in extensive lobbying efforts to minimize public scrutiny and transparency of Epic’s financials to avoid criticism of their profits and to avoid financial penalties imposed on public schools with administrative costs over the 5% maximum allowed — because those financial penalties would also have reduced their personal profits.
When asked for an example, Brock cited House Bill 1395, authored by now-former State Rep. Sheila Dills, R-Tulsa, to ensure that schools that contract with outside companies for their management are not diverting dollars away from students on more administrative overhead costs than allowed by law.
It requires schools with outside management organizations to provide the state with itemized, rather than estimated, expenditure information.
Brock said Harris and Chaney held multiple meetings with Dills “so we could live with it.” An earlier draft “would have resulted in greater transparency. In our minds at the time, it would have been a greater scrutiny of the invoices.
“We did not want the EYS records public. … Obviously the level of profit was great from most standards.”
Brock said many changes were implemented after the office of State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd delivered damning findings in an October 2020 investigative audit of Epic. Byrd has called the case the “largest abuse of taxpayer funds in the history of this state.”
One of those changes was to address Brock’s own self-described “conflict of interest” as both the school’s and EYS’ CFO.
A woman who testified earlier in the week, Jeanise Wynn, was recruited from a traditional public school district and began to more closely scrutinize EYS invoices internally, Brock said.
Then HB 1395 went into effect, and the new scrutiny of Epic’s overhead costs with EYS resulted in its charter school administrative costs exceeding Oklahoma’s state law that caps it at 5%.
The result?
The Oklahoma State Department of Education slapped Epic with $20.7 million in dollar-for-dollar penalties for excessive administrative costs.

From Dec. 9, 2021: Now-former Epic Charter Schools board Vice Chair Kathren Stehno and Chair Paul Campbell are shown in this screenshot from a livestream of Epic’s Nov. 17 board meeting.
Investigations by state education officials and authorizers of Oklahoma’s largest charter school system were prompted by a host of allegations forwarded to them directly by Epic school board member Kathren Stehno.
Contacted by the Tulsa World, Stehno said she came to believe she had been given false, partial or misleading information by Paul Campbell, Epic’s board chairman, and Superintendent Bart Banfield in recent months to influence her decision-making as a board member.
Then, she said, she was approached recently by multiple “whistleblowers” from within Epic’s ranks of employees with allegations that Epic leaders had doled out high-dollar bonuses to a handful of top administrators without school board authorization and violated state law and school policy in the way it withdrew “a high percentage” of its students for truancy.
From Dec. 9, 2021: Current leaders at Epic Charter Schools are denying any wrongdoing amid allegations from a governing board member who just stepped down in protest over administrative bonuses and a reduction in force she said were unauthorized.
“Epic is investigating these claims. To date, we have not found evidence supporting the allegations,” states an unsigned letter from the school to Epic parents on Wednesday.

From Nov. 17, 2021: Epic Charter Schools is implementing a reduction in force because “three out of five kids who came to EPIC due to the pandemic have chosen to return to their home districts,” it announced Tuesday.
At the school system’s October governing board meeting, school leaders said Epic currently enrolls a total of 38,556 students between its two schools, which would represent an overall decline of around 35% since Epic’s pandemic all-time high. That number includes students who were already enrolled at Epic as well as the new students who chose that route because of the pandemic.
The statewide virtual charter school called Epic One-on-One now counts 22,946 students, and Epic Blended Learning Centers, which offers a blend of online and in-person learning, now has 15,610 students in Tulsa and Oklahoma counties.
During the noon hour Tuesday, Epic Superintendent Bart Banfield posted on Epic’s website and shared to its social media channels an announcement to students and parents titled: “We’re right-sizing as our enrollment normalizes.”

Sept. 16, 2021: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Thursday formally requested that the State Auditor and Inspector’s Office conduct a first-of-its-kind investigative audit of the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
The audit will have two primary objectives:
Identify all revenue sources flowing into OSDE — including federal funds, state appropriations, taxes and fees — and determine whether the revenues were properly allocated and expenditures from selected funds were made in accordance with applicable laws.
Determine whether OSDE and Oklahoma school districts are complying with Oklahoma Cost Accounting System reporting requirements and whether OSDE is “effectively requiring consistent application and timely accountability.”
“This type of audit has never been conducted in the history of Oklahoma and, perhaps, the nation,” said State Auditor Cindy Byrd. “As always, these audits are about transparency and accountability to taxpayers. I commend Gov. Stitt for requesting this audit. People want to know how their tax dollars are spent on education.”

From July 14, 2021: Epic Charter Schools was just given four additional months to grapple with how it might fully comply with a settlement agreement that preserved its sponsorship by the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board.
At issue is the fact that Epic has maintained one single governing board with the same members for both of its two legally separate schools while the two schools share administrators and many teachers.
Because state funds for the two schools were found to have been commingled in previous years, the terms of its 2-month-old consent agreement with the virtual board require Epic to have shared service agreements — approved by independent school governing boards — if it continues to share employees.
After Tuesday’s meeting of the virtual school board, Epic Superintendent Bart Banfield expressed some frustration but said the school’s leadership will use the extra time just allotted to contemplate whether Epic’s two schools should even have two separate local governing boards — or whether it should pursue even more radical change as one single school.
“We’ve already undergone so much change before this consent agreement was ever contemplated,” Banfield said. “But this gives us more time for conversation, both for us and with them (the statewide virtual board).”
The Statewide Virtual Charter School Board sponsors Epic One-on-One, Oklahoma’s largest online public school, and five other smaller statewide virtual charter schools, which are all open to any child living in Oklahoma.

Nov. 11, 2020: Some Republican lawmakers are calling for an audit of the State Department of Education, citing a recent audit that found problems with Epic Charter Schools and the agency. “If the state auditor is correct in her assessment that the State Department of Education repeatedly neglected its responsibility to ensure compliance with OCAS (Oklahoma Cost Accounting System) and other required reports, one must ask if this dereliction of duty was confined solely to Epic Charter Schools or if it permeates throughout or public education system,” said a statement released by the lawmakers. “If SDE did in fact routinely fail to perform its regulatory duties, this could result in the discovery of hundreds of millions of dollars of misused funds.”

The Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector’s Oct. 1 report found oversight to be lacking on the part of Epic’s “handpicked” governing board members, selected by school co-founders David Chaney and Ben Harris, “whose for-profit school management company contract and performance should be overseen by an independent board,” the report states.
In all, $125.2 million of the $458 million allocated to Epic Charter Schools for educating students the past six years was found to have ended up in the coffers of Epic Youth Services, Chaney and Harris’ charter school management company, which reportedly has made them millionaires.

Oct. 5, 2020: State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister is vowing to take new actions to “recoup” millions in taxpayer dollars from Epic Charter Schools amid a new forensic audit that paints a damning picture of her administration’s handling of Epic for many years.
The office of State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd found within the Oklahoma State Department of Education an accounting system preoccupied with school district compliance — with little to no verification of the information they report or accountability for falsehoods or other failings.
In an interview with the Tulsa World, Hofmeister pointed to an earlier reporting deadline imposed on schools last year that already resulted in the state Board of Education slapping Epic with a $530,000 penalty.

Oct. 2, 2020: The Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector’s much-anticipated investigative audit of Epic Charter Schools has found it sends about 1 in 4 taxpayer dollars it receives as a public school to its co-founders’ for-profit company.
Part I of what is expected to be a two-part report documented accounting practices that allowed Ben Harris and David Chaney’s Epic Youth Services charter school management company to boost their earnings by nearly $2 million amid lax school board oversight and little to no accountability for Epic schools’ chronically inaccurate cost reporting to state education officials.
In all, $125.2 million of the $458 million allocated to Epic Charter Schools for educating students the past six years ended up in the coffers of EYS, according to State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd.

Oct. 1, 2020: Although the state audit of Epic Charter Schools took more than a year to complete, reactions to some of its findings on Oct. 1 came much more swiftly.
The first of what is expected to be a two-part report — which detailed improper transfers, chronic misreporting of costs and lax oversight — was released Oct. 1 afternoon by State Auditor Cindy Byrd in conjunction with a news conference.

Epic One-on-One and Epic Blended Learning Centers paid EYS, the school co-founders' for-profit management company a total of $79.3 million in taxpayer money for student learning needs in lump sum payments first detailed to the public in an investigation by the Tulsa World. But EYS has blocked the state auditor access to records of how those public dollars are being spent.
Epic Youth Services “erroneously received” an excess of $686,0000 in management fees for the last five years, and the school’s own, handpicked auditors failed to identify the calculation issue year in and year out. The state auditor said EYS should return those dollars to the schools.
Epic Youth Services, the school co-founders' for-profit charter school management company, “improperly transferred” $203,000 in Oklahoma taxpayer dollars from the student Learning Fund account to help cover payroll shortages at Epic’s California charter school.
Epic has improperly commingled, or mixed, public dollars allocated for its two, separate charter schools, including the use of one single bank account for student Learning Funds for both schools. The audit also found $6 million in payments and $3.3 million in loans from one school to the other without school board approval.
Epic’s multi-year deals totaling $525,000, for the school’s promotional advertising and branding on playgrounds inside shopping malls in Tulsa and Oklahoma City violate the Oklahoma Constitution.
