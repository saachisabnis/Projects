Travis Kelce grinned — and even appeared to be blushing — when Taylor Swift sang about an engagement in “Love Story” during London’s first Eras Tour show Friday. 
In a video circulating social media, the pro football star can be seen dancing to the beat of his girlfriend’s hit song and cracking a smirk as she sang, “He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring / And said, “Marry me, Juliet / You’ll never have to be alone.”
Fans caught onto his childlike smile, which got them excited about the possibility of an engagement in their future. 
“It’s probably my imagination but…. It really looks like Travis gives a small, sly grin when she sings about kneeling and pulling out a ring,” one X user commented.
“She has watched so many women be proposed to at her concerts, what if he walked out on stage during that song and proposed to her???” a TikTok fan questioned. 
“I meannnn, his smirk, the song, the whole gang being there, all I’m saying is that it wouldn’t be a bad time 😉,” a third hinted. 
Swifties were also thrilled to see Travis’ brother, Jason Kelce, letting loose in the VIP tent behind him. Jason’s wife, Kylie Kelce, was also in attendance at the show.
While the Kansas City Chiefs tight end has kept his lips sealed about any engagement plans, a person close to the couple told Page Six earlier this year that they’ve “discussed” getting engaged around their first anniversary in July. 
“Scott has been asked for his blessing and has wholeheartedly given it, and Travis has been talking to friends about a ring,” another source told us last December.
Swift and Travis, both 34, went public with their romance in September 2023 when the singer attended her beau’s NFL game against the Chicago Bears.
She rooted him on at 12 more games throughout his football season, while he, in return, has flown to    South America, Asia and Europe to see her work the stage. 
For more Page Six you love…
Despite some backlash, the “Midnights” singer made it clear she and Travis are not ashamed of showing off their love during her Time 2023 Person of the Year profile. 
“When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she noted.
“The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”
Earlier this month, Kelce revealed that one of his favorite things to do with the Grammy winner is cook. 
“Taylor makes a great Pop-Tart and cinnamon roll,” he added.
