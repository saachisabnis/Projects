Nearly three years after the tragic crowd crush at Travis Scott’s Astroworld Festival claimed the lives of 10 concertgoers, event promoter Live Nation has reached settlements in nine of the ten wrongful death lawsuits resulting from the deadly disaster.
As one lawsuit, filed by the family of Madison Dubiski, was poised to commence trial this week, news of the other settlements emerged.
The announcement of settlements follows revelations from the US Justice Department last month detailing their plans to sue Live Nation for antitrust violations. The government alleges the live entertainment giant’s dominance has stifled competition in ticketing events, effectively creating a monopoly presiding over the industry. 
Back to the settlements. During a recent hearing, Live Nation attorney Neal Manne confirmed the settlements, including that of Dubiski, a 23-year-old Houston resident, who was among the victims, as reported by the Associated Press.
Terms were withheld due to a gag order preventing information regarding the resolution to be divulged to the public. The remaining lawsuit, brought by the family of nine-year-old Ezra Blount, the youngest victim, is slated for trial.
Astroworld Festival, which debuted on Nov. 5, 2021, at NRG Park in Houston, Texas, turned deadly as concertgoers were crushed, with at least eight immediate fatalities and two more deaths were confirmed at the hospital. The aftermath saw over 4,000 attendees filing hundreds of civil personal injury lawsuits, with 2,400 injury cases still pending.
