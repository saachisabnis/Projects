WWE is ramping up the hype for Raw’s Netflix debut.
Overnight, the promotion confirmed that the premiere episode of Raw on Netflix will take place from the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California. Paul “Triple H” Levesque announced the news while making a surprise appearance at a concert by rap star Travis Scott at ComplexCon. Levesque also announced that Scott will be appearing at the episode — and WWE has now revealed that new music from Scott will serve as the theme song for Raw on Netflix.
The premiere is taking place on January 6. WWE is advertising John Cena, Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, CM Punk, and Bianca Belair for the episode, along with “many other Superstars and surprise guests.” This is the first date that Cena is working as part of his retirement tour that will last throughout 2025.
Scott also attended an episode of Raw back in March of this year. One of the most popular rappers in the world, Scott has used Cactus Jack as a nickname and named his record label Cactus Jack Records.
The Intuit Dome is a newly opened venue that is the home arena for the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers. Tickets for Raw’s Netflix debut are going on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Pacific time this Friday (November 22) with a pre-sale beginning at 10 a.m. Pacific on Wednesday.
