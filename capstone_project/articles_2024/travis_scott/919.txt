Tyler, The Creator’s latest album Chromakopia has rocketed to the top of the Billboard 200, marking his most successful first week to date. According to Billboard, Tyler’s eighth studio album debuted at number one, moving 299,500 equivalent units. Of that impressive total, 157,000 came from on-demand streams, which reached 212.55 million plays, while pure album sales accounted for 142,000 units. An additional 500 units came from track equivalent albums (TEA).
This remarkable feat gives Chromakopia the second-highest debut for any rap album this year, coming in just behind the commercial release of Travis Scott’s Days Before Rodeo with 361,000 units. For Tyler, Chromakopia represents his strongest debut yet, surpassing previous chart-toppers IGOR and Call Me If You Get Lost, which each opened with around 165,000 and 169,000 units, respectively. Notably, Chromakopia achieved this milestone despite a short tracking week, dropping on a Monday rather than the industry standard Friday.
Elsewhere on the Billboard 200, Eminem’s The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) climbed from number 44 to number six following its vinyl release. Meanwhile, Rod Wave’s Last Lap remains in the top five, and GloRilla’s debut album Glorious shifted from number seven to number 10.
After releasing Chromakopia, Tyler shared some personal insights on each track with fans on X (formerly Twitter). “At 1:54 of ST CHROMA, that siren and low end together feels like a blast wave after an explosion,” he wrote, revealing the specific sounds and details behind his favorite moments. Describing JUDGE JUDY, he said, “the synth lead out of it? donald’s descending harmonies on the last verse? the ending keeps transposing up, this my favorite song.” He expressed his gratitude to fans, signing off with, “thank you all for listening.”
