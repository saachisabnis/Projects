Everyone knows Travis Scott is a sneaker sage. Ben Affleck knows. Bradley Cooper too. And with the new Nike Killshot 2 ‘Phantom’, it seems his influence is touching non-Travis Scott trainers. Because, if you took an L on big drops like the Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low ‘Phantom’ from 2022, this is the ultimate alt.
Nike Killshot 2 ‘Phantom’
While most Killshot 2s come in white, cream, and sometimes even grey (if you're lucky), this is a stealthier version. Like the Travis Scott collab, this is black. Pitch black. It's also made from materials like leather and nylon, and it's contrasted with clean white stitching that runs across the entire upper. If you didn't know any better, you'd easily mistaken these for the Cactus Jack pair, which currently re-sells for around £1,000 a pop.

But the biggest difference is that the Nike Swoosh on the lateral sidewall faces the “normal” way, and the midsole isn't infused with any fancy Air tech. Instead, it's made from a classic rubber construction that's inspired by OG tennis shoes from back in the day.
And while you probably won't be playing any tennis with these, the Killshot 2 was a big hitter in Luca Guadagnino's Challengers. Josh O'Connor's Patrick Zweig swore by them, and if he's a big fan, you probably should be too.

The Nike Killshot 2 ‘Phantom’ is set to drop sometime within the coming weeks. It'll be available at Nike, the Snkrs app, and select stockists across the globe, and will set you back £85.
