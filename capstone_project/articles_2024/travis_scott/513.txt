After having been worn by Travis Scott for the last year, his debut signature sneaker from Jordan has been officially confirmed for a wide release. 
The Jordan Jumpman Jack will release at the end of April in its “Sail and Dark Mocha” colorway following a surprise release for the sneaker during the Grammys in February. Thanks to advance notice and greater stock, the odds of landing a pair should be higher than before — although still far from guaranteed given the amount of hype surrounding the model. 
While bearing similarities to the Air Jordan 1 High and Low with its two straps overlays and toe shape, the low-top Jumpman Jack counts a new sole unit and a velcro strap toward the bottom of the laces as its signature elements. Also making a return is a backwards lateral Swoosh, a through-line for the rapper’s many sneaker collaborations, and the use of “Dark Mocha,” which has made a nontrivial amount of appearances on Scott’s shoes itself. Most of the leather, nubuck and canvas shoe, however, appears in off-white “Sail.”

Scott’s smiley face logo appears on the heel, and the Jumpman logo sits on both the tongue and insole, but the “Cactus Jack” cross mark his fans are well acquainted with is nowhere to be found. “Jack” script can be read on the translucent gum outsole and will wear away with time, and the raised “TS” mark on the strap is intended to provide grip while adjusting the shoe’s fit. 
In the product description for the sneaker, Jordan Brand says the Jumpman Jack is “built for handling the raging rigors of Travis’ nonstop lifestyle as an elite performance athlete—delivering traction, comfort and confidence when embracing day-to-day extremes.” 
An additional colorway of the Jumpman Jack that swaps brown for black while adding a red Swoosh and off-white outsole is also expected to release soon as well. For those living in Houston, it already dropped last week via a Snkrs Pass rollout. 
The Jordan Jumpman Jack “Sail and Dark Mocha” will release April 30 through the Snkrs app. Sizing is available for men ($200), little kids ($90) and toddlers ($75).
