Bio: Oregon recruited the three-star prospect out of Sheldon High School. He entered fall camp in 2016 as a likely candidate to redshirt but became the starter by the season’s sixth game and never looked back.
Key statistics: Herbert became the Ducks’ first true freshman quarterback to start a game since Chris Miller in 1983.
Herbert ended the season with 1,936 passing yards, 19 touchdown passes, and only four interceptions.
He set single-game records for total offensive yards (512 vs. ASU), passing yards (489 vs. ASU, tied with Bill Musgrave), and touchdown passes (six vs. California, tied with seven others).
Unfortunately, the Ducks saw their worst season in 25 years (4-8) and failed to make a bowl game appearance for the first time in over decade.
Herbert’s sophomore year saw him transition to a new offense under a new head coach. However, a collarbone injury in late September against California sidelined him for five games.
He ended the season with 1,983 yards passing with 15 touchdowns and five interceptions.
In 2018, despite being his third head coach, Herbert led the Ducks to a 9-4 record and a Redbox Bowl victory.
He threw for 3,151 yards (eighth all-time at UO) and 29 touchdowns (tied for ninth) against just eight interceptions and was named second-team All-Pac-12.
Herbert returned for his senior year and led the Ducks to a 12-2 record, the conference championship in an upset win over Utah, and a Rose Bowl victory against Wisconsin. Herbert for three scores in the game and was named offensive MVP.
Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert rolls out to throw as the Ducks face the Oregon State Beavers in the 123d edition of the Civil War on Saturday, Nov. 30, 2019 at Autzen Stadium in Eugene.
On the season, Herbert threw for 3,471 yards and (sixth) 32 touchdowns (tied, fourth) with six interceptions.
That season, he was named first-team All-Pac-12 and received the William V. Campbell Trophy, also known as the “Academic Heisman.”
Herbert ended his career with 10,541 yards passing (second to Marcus Mariota) on 1,293 attempts (first) with 827 completions (first) and 95 touchdown passes (second to Mariota). His 64% completion rate ranks third all-time.
Herbert amassed 11,101 yards of total offense (second to Mariota).

NFL: The Los Angeles Chargers chose Herbert with the No. 6 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.
He was named AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2020 and made the Pro Bowl in 2021
He holds NFL rookie records for passing touchdowns (31), completions (396), pass attempts per game (career, 39.1), and most pass completions per game (career, 26.0). As of 2023, he has passed for 17,223 yards and 114 touchdowns.

Oregon quarterback Dennis Dixon against Arizona State in 2007 at Autzen Stadium. Bruce Ely/The Oregonian LC- THE OREGONIAN
Bio: Oregon recruited Dixon as a four-star dual-threat quarterback out of San Leandro High School (California) in 2004.
Key statistics: Dixon won the backup job behind Kellen Clemens in 2004.
When Clemens broke his leg late during the 2005 season, Dixon split time with Brady Leaf. The pair helped lead the Ducks to the Holiday Bowl, where they lost to Oklahoma to finish the season 10-2.
Coach Mike Bellotti had high hopes for Dixon in 2006. Bellotti had moved to the spread offense in 2005 partly to take advantage of Dixon’s versatility as a running quarterback.
However, Dixon failed to quite put things together after a strong start. He threw 10 touchdown passes with five interceptions over the first six games to help UO jump out to a 6-1 start.
From that point on, he threw just two touchdown passes with nine interceptions and ultimately lost the starting job to Leaf, with the pair sharing quarterback duties.
Dixon ended the year with 2,143 yards and 12 touchdown passes with 14 interceptions. He rushed for 442 yards and two scores.
Bellotti then hired Chip Kelly as offensive coordinator and he managed to unlock Dixon’s potential.
Late in 2007, the Ducks were ranked No. 2 in the nation, and Dixon was the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy.
Dixon’s growth became crystal clear during a 39-7 win at Michigan in Week 2.
Dixon passed for 292 yards and three touchdowns while rushing for 76 yards and a score.
Unfortunately, he injured his knee in a game at home against Arizona State. He tried to play the following week at Arizona but reinjured the knee shortly after jetting off for a 39-yard touchdown run.
Dixon completed 67.7% of his passes (fifth all-time at UO) for 2,136 yards and 20 touchdowns with just four interceptions. He also rushed for 583 yards (eighth for a quarterback) with nine scores (tied, fifth for a quarterback).
Dixon’s career completion percentage (63.9) ranks fourth.
Dixon finished his career with 1,208 yards rushing (third for a quarterback).
His career 6,337 all-purpose yards rank 10th.
NFL: Pittsburgh selected Dixon in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL draft. He spent three seasons with the Steelers, winning a Super Bown ring during the 2008 season.
