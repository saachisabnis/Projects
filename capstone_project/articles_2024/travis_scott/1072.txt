Pharrell Williams is celebrating his birthday with some new music. On Friday, April 5, the seasoned artist delivered his third studio album Black Yacht Rock Vol. 1. The 10-track project is a genre-bending experience that you won't find on streaming services. Pharrell quietly released the album exclusively on the album's official website where fans can download the album for free.99. Each song has timestamps that seemingly indicate the songs were created within the past month. Some stand-out tracks include "Richard Millie," "Dandy Lying," "Ball" and "Going Back To VA." His ode to his home state of Virginia arrived on his 51st birthday. 
Black Yacht Rock Vol. 1 arrives 10 years after he dropped his previous solo album Girl featuring his smash hit "Happy." The album also contains collaborations with Justin Timberlake and Alicia Keys. Pharrell dropped plenty of rare hits since then like last year's "Airplane Tickets" with Swae Lee and Rauw Alejandro and his 2022 songs "Down In Atlanta" featuring Travis Scott and "Cash In Cash Out" with 21 Savage and Tyler The Creator. He's also worked with a slew of other artists for their respective projects including Summer Walker, Jack Harlow, Moneyabgg Yo and more. Stream the album here and check out the tracklist below.
