Kylie Jenner’s 6-year-old daughter may “look like Mommy, baby!”, but her 2-year-old son Aire takes more after his big sister. The Kylie Cosmetics founder just shared a super-sweet new photo of her and her baby boy, and his angel face is exactly like Stormi’s!

	










	“Forever love,” Jenner captioned the photo on Instagram today. The heartwarming moment shows Jenner holding Aire on a chair, with one hand wrapped around his back and supporting his neck. They lean in to touch noses, making Jenner smile and Aire grin with cute cheeks and his eyes shut tight. His hair is in braids, and he looks absolutely adorable with his mama.

	Jenner’s sister Khloé Kardashian commented, “The sweetest.” Others noted Aire’s resemblance to his big sis. “looks like Stormi when she was a kid🥹❣️,” one person wrote. (Quick note: 6 years old is still a kid!)

	Others thought he looked like his mom. “Aire u look like mommy baby!!!😫” someone else wrote. “his twin in the boy version!! he is more beautiful every day. 😍😍🤍” another commented.



	The Khy founder, who shares Aire and Stormi with ex Travis Scott, recently took her kids to Italy. She was seen in a pretty denim mini dress while walking around with her kids in photos obtained by Page Six. She also shared a few snaps on her Instagram story, including one picture of herself in a black, open-back minidress. She holds Aire and smiles as he points to a fountain beyond. She also shared a quick clip of Stormi on a boat, looking out over the water in the evening. It looks like such a peaceful getaway!

	In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Jenner opened up about how becoming a mom has changed her. “My daughter has totally taught me a lot more about myself, and seeing myself in her has changed everything. I’ve had so much growth and am just embracing natural beauty,” she said, per USA Today. “I’m teaching her about mistakes that I made and making sure she knows she’s just perfect exactly how she is.”



	And now that Aire is getting older, we have no doubt she’ll pass along the same messages to him.
