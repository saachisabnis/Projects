It's officially been one month since Paramount Plus completed its merger with Showtime, and now that we've already entered February (if you can believe it), we've got an even larger selection of TV shows and movies to wade through post-merger. As you may recall, now Paramount Plus with Showtime subscribers can watch new and old Showtime hits like "Yellowjackets" and "Dexter."
But TV shows and films aren't the only reason you'll want to have a Paramount Plus subscription right now. The new on Paramount Plus list this month includes the biggest sporting event of the year, Super Bowl 2024, as well as season 2 of the live-action adaptation of popular video game series "Halo."
Also new on Paramount Plus this month is the platform's debut of its original animated feature film "The Tiger's Apprentice" as well as the streaming premiere of the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. Check out everything that's new on Paramount Plus in February 2024 below.
Tom Lee's (Brandon Soo Hoo) life in San Francisco's Chinatown takes an extraordinary turn when he learns his eccentric grandmother is the guardian of a mythical phoenix egg. Thrust into a world of ancient magic after his grandmother's mysterious death, Tom reluctantly becomes the apprentice of Mr. Hu (Henry Golding), a wise and mystical tiger. 
Together with a diverse group of creatures embodying the Chinese zodiac, each possessing unique human and animal traits, Tom embarks on a journey to reunite the divided Zodiac animal warriors and become the new protector of his grandmother's egg. 
Premieres February 2 on Paramount Plus
The live-action adaptation of the "Halo" video game series returns, with Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 (Pablo Schreiber) and his team of Spartans confronting the escalating alien menace known as the Covenant. Following a strange encounter on a remote world, John is haunted by a premonition of war, leading him to throw convention to the wind in his quest for the truth. 
Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.
As tensions mount across the galaxy, he sets off on a dangerous mission to uncover the secret of the ring-shaped Halo, an artifact that could either be humanity's savior or herald its doom. In this chapter, alliances are tested and destinies intertwined, as the very fate of humanity hangs in the balance. 
Premieres February 8 on Paramount Plus
The Big Game, as you will, is coming, and you're going to want to make some time to watch the sparks fly at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada this year as your favorite football teams go head to head in a battle for supremacy in front of the entire world. 
Take some time out to groove along with Usher during the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, and don't forget to check out all the commercials, which always bring down the house sometimes even harder than the actual plays themselves. Whether you're into sports or just the spectacle, you won't want to miss this event.
