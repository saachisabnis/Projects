Travis Scott, Live Nation Entertainment, and other defendants have settled the last remaining wrongful death lawsuit they were facing in the wake of the 2021 Astroworld tragedy, the Houston Chronicle reports. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Ezra Blount, the youngest victim of the crowd crush. In a statement to the Houston Chronicle, S. Scott West, an attorney for the Blount family said, “The family is happy to resolve its claim against all defendants following the death of their son, Ezra. They look forward to continuing the process of healing and never forgetting.”
Ezra Blount was just 9 years old when he attended the Astroworld festival with his father. He was trampled during the crowd crush and placed in a medically-induced coma. He died in the days after the festival, becoming the 10th victim of the crush.
Scott and his co-defendants settled many of the wrongful death lawsuits earlier this month. The Blount family’s case had remained unresolved, and a trial date had been set for September.
Following an investigation that took nearly two years, a Texas grand jury declined to indict Travis Scott on criminal charges related to Astroworld. There is still active civil litigation against the rapper, and he is scheduled to go to trial in October.
