Brittany Mahomes is showing off her new merch straight from the stands.
Mahomes, 29, attended the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Las Vegas Raiders at Arrowhead Stadium on Friday, November 29. While sitting with her 3-year-old daughter, Sterling and cheering on husband Patrick Mahomes, Brittany showed off her game day fit via her Instagram Story. (The couple also share son Bronze, 2.)
Brittany, who is currently pregnant with the pair’s third baby, rocked one of the T-shirt designs that she teamed up with Amazon to create. The shirt, which comes in white and black, features a red Chiefs logo placed on top of a silver arrowhead. Under the logo, the team’s name is emblazoned in a cursive font and has their four Super Bowl titles displayed underneath. Brittany opted for the black shirt for the game.
In addition to the T-shirt, Brittany rocked a black turtleneck underneath plus a fuzzy black coat. Her hair featured her signature curls, and she kept her makeup simple with black eyeliner. She completed the look with bright red boots.
“Live now on @amazon, this game AND my custom @nfl merch ❤️,” Brittany captioned a snap of her full look on Instagram. “Tune in on @primevideo and shop my shirt and other game day essentials on my storefront linked in my bio and on Stories!”
Ahead of the game, Brittany gave an inside look at her go-to game day essentials plus her custom merch.
“It’s GAME DAYYY!!!” she wrote via her story on Friday. “Excited to show y’all the custom merch I made for today’s game that you can shop at Amazon!”
Patrick, also 29, showed off his support for his wife’s venture as he wore the limited-edition shirt when he arrived at Arrowhead for the game.
“Yes of course we had to match 😊❤️,” Brittany captioned a pic of the quarterback rocking her design.
Brittany isn’t the only significant other of a football player who designed a top for Amazon’s collection. Olivia Culpo and Rachel Crosby also collaborated with the brands in honor of their partners’ respective teams, the San Francisco 49ers and the Raiders.

Brittany wasn’t the only A-lister in attendance at Friday’s game. Pal Taylor Swift attended the event with her dad, Scott Swift, and Travis Kelce’s mom, Donna Kelce. Swift, 34, kept her look sporty with a red three-quarter zip sweater and black jeans. She added some bling with a sparkly necklace with 87 — which is Travis’ number — on the chain.
When Brittany and Patrick aren’t rocking matching looks, Brittany is always slaying her game day fits as she cheers on the Chiefs. During last week’s game, Brittany opted for black turtleneck with matching jeans and riding boots. She completed the look with a red jacket that featured her and Patrick’s last name on the back.
While on the field before the game, Patrick and Brittany shared a sweet smooch on the sidelines before the Chiefs took on the Carolina Panthers at Charlotte’s Bank of America Stadium.
