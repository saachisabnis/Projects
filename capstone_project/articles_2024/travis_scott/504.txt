Earlier today (Jun. 21, 2024), Ariana Grande released a remix of her Eternal Sunshine track “The Boy Is Mine” featuring Brandy and Monica, who released their version of the same-named R&B classic in 1998.
“How can it be? You and me, might be meant to be, can’t unsee it, but I don’t wanna cause no scene, I’m usually so unproblematic, so independent, tell me why, Cause the boy is mine, mine,” the song begins alongside Brandy’s vocals.
Following Grande’s chorus, Monica took on the next verse as their vocals and harmonies were layered on top of one another.
The black-and-white lyric video also featured eye-catching visuals of a newspaper, comic book, and TV screens alongside the lyrics and pictures of the trio.
