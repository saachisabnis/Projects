The holiday season is the perfect opportunity for everyone to give back to their communities however they can. Artists like Travis Scott are dedicated to making kids smile during Christmastime every year.

Scott teamed up with his family HBCU alma mater, Texas Southern University (TSU), and the Houston Food Bank to provide 1,000 families from the Houston community with toys, bikes, sneakers, food and more. They gave away 2,000 toys & bikes, 1,000 bags of food and 200 Nike Cactus Jack sneakers. 
Meanwhile in Atlanta, 21 Savage and his Leading By Example organization hosted their 6th annual Holiday Toy Drive before Christmas. 21 and his team took over the Porter Sanford III Performing Arts & Community Center in Panthersville to give away over 3,000 toys, bicycles, clothes and meals to more than 1,000 families with children.
