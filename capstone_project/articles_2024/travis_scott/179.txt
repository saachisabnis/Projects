Taking a deep look into this year’s outlook for Nebraska at 184 pounds, the national outlook at the weight, who’s next, and how the Huskers have fared historically at the weight
We are moving on in our series of deep-dives into each and every weight class — we’re onto 184 pounds now. We’re moving weight-by-weight with each preview coming out on Wednesday. You’ll get a detailed summary and outlook of the roster going into the 2024-25 season, see what the weight class looks like nationally, look ahead to who could be next in line, and look back at who has excelled and earned All-American honors at the weight in the past for the Huskers.

Everything you’ll need to know to get ready for this coming season (which will be here before we know it) is right here. Check back each Wednesday for the next preview, with the 197-pound weight class coming next week.
Nebraska has a luxury at 184 pounds with junior Lenny Pinto returning to hold down the weight for a third straight year. Pinto enters this season ranked #8 in the country by FloWrestling.
Now, his first two seasons haven’t ended the way he wanted them to, but Pinto has been on the verge of breaking through into the elite class for a while now. Before coming to Nebraska, Pinto was a Pennsylvania state champion and top recruit but suffered a knee injury and missed his senior season of high school. Upon arriving at Nebraska in 2021, Pinto re-aggravated the injury and required surgery, so he missed his redshirt year completely as well.
After two full years away from competition due to injuries (from his original injury in Oct. 2020 until his Husker debut in Nov. 2022), Pinto had an up-and-down redshirt freshman year. As the starter, Pinto had a solid start to the year, highlighted by a 5-4 win over then-#4 Trey Munoz of Oregon State at the Cliff Keen Invitational in Las Vegas. He finished fifth at Big Tens and qualified for NCAAs but went 1-2 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He finished his season with a 22-11 record but flashed a lot of potential.
As a sophomore this past season, Pinto improved his consistency while still exhibiting that strength and explosiveness that makes him such a tough wrestler to compete against. At CKLV, he picked up a win over eventual NCAA finalist Dustin Plott of Oklahoma State 12-10 before falling to him 11-7 in the 3rd-place match. He also scored wins over #5 Bennett Berge of SDSU, #14 Jaden Bullock of Michigan, and twice beat four-time All-American Bernie Truax of Penn State (despite losing to him at the Big Ten Championships). 
Here’s Pinto’s dual win over Truax.
Once again, Pinto fell short of the podium at NCAAs where he went 2-2, taking losses to Berge and Munoz, two guys he had already beaten. He certainly improved on the year as he was consistently ranked #3 in the country, finishing with a 24-6 record, but the All-American honor still eludes him.
I’m confident Pinto has what it takes to finish his final two seasons near the top however. His potential is still sky-high and he’s proven to be improving consistently. That makes me think he will have jumped another level this offseason.
Behind Pinto will be redshirt freshman Ethan DeLeon. DeLeon went 17-6 while redshirting this past season, including a 6-2 mark against Division I opponents. In high school, he was a two-time state finalist in Iowa for Bishop Heelan. 
This summer, DeLeon placed sixth at the U20 US Open with a 5-3 record, securing him a spot in the U20 World Team Trials at 79 kg. He finished with a 1-2 record at the U20 WTT. Coming off a redshirt, DeLeon will be a solid backup for Pinto in case the Huskers need to rest him. 
Another option for Nebraska here would be Elise Brown Ton who wrestles primarily at 174. Last season, Brown Ton filled in for a pair of duals for Pinto and went 1-1, downing Wyoming’s Tyce Raddon 10-3 before dropping a match via 17-2 tech fall to eventual NCAA Champion Parker Keckeisen of UNI.
As mentioned in the 174-pound preview, there are rumors that Bubba Wilson, Pinto and Silas Allred are all moving down in weight to go 165-174-184 in an attempt to get freshman Camden McDanel into the lineup at 197. A U20 World bronze medalist, McDanel will be an impact guy from the start. 
If Allred can successfully make the move down to 184, I would be pretty surprised. Allred has wrestled at 197 his entire career so far and wrestles at 92 kg (203 pounds) in freestyle. He also wrestled a match last year at heavyweight, so he would probably be the biggest 184-pounder in the country if he ends up there.
If this does in fact happen, there are certain to be other weight class moves. For instance, if Pinto does move down to 174, it’s likely that one or both of Elise Brown Ton and Christopher Minto move up to 184. I think they both have the size for the move. 
If this happens, it’s also no guarantee that Wilson will start at 165. He’ll likely be contending with Jagger Condomitti, Dez Gartrell and LJ Araujo for that spot.
Most people think Penn State’s four-time NCAA Champion at 174 pounds Carter Starocci will be moving up to 184 for his senior season after previously expressing interest in moving up to 197. He’s currently ranked #1 over returning NCAA Champion Parker Keckeisen of UNI who went undefeated last year on the way to his title. 
A senior, Keckeisen was dominant on the way to his title, scoring bonus points in more than 90 percent of his matches. Keckeisen has beaten Pinto twice in his career, both at CKLV – 11-2 in 2022 and 8-4 in 2023.
I can’t imagine Keckeisen is ready to relinquish his crown to Starocci, so this potential NCAA final between two all-time greats in their senior years may be the most anticipated match in all of college wrestling.
Behind Keckeisen is #3 Plott of Oklahoma State who holds a 2-1 record against Pinto. He fell to Keckeisen via 14-5 major decision in the NCAA final. Then there’s #3 Trey Munoz of Oregon State returning for his final season after finishing third at NCAAs. Iowa’s #4 Nelson Brands returns from a gambling suspension for his final year and could end up at 184 as well. Both #5 Berge (4th place) and #6 Edmond Ruth of Illinois (7th at 174) will also be in the field after finishing on the podium a year ago. 
Nebraska has the perfect scenario here with an established starter with two years of eligibility and a commit for the class of 2025 that will come in, redshirt and take over as a redshirt freshman. That is theoretically of course.
One of Nebraska’s three commits for the 2025 class is Ty Eise out of Colorado. Ranked #3 in the country at 175 pounds, Eise is ranked as the #24 overall prospect in the class of 2025. He’ll come in as a freshman next year and redshirt while Pinto finishes out his career. He’ll then compete for the open job in 2026 with four years of eligibility remaining.
DeLeon is talented, but I don’t think he’ll be able to beat out Eise for the job when that time comes. There’s also the outside chance that Minto moves up from 174 to 184 eventually, so he’d be in the mix as well if he does. 
The modern-day weight classes first started in 1998-99. That coincides almost exactly with Mark Manning’s start as Nebraska’s head coach, his first year at the helm being the 1999-2000 season. So, we’re going back 26 years here to show you Nebraska’s All-Americans at 184 pounds.
1999- Brad Vering (4th)
2005- Travis Pascoe (6th)
2009- Vince Jones (6th)
2012- Josh Ihnen (8th)
2015- TJ Dudley (8th)
2016- TJ Dudley (2nd)
2017- TJ Dudley (3rd)
2018- Taylor Venz (4th)
This is the weight where Nebraska has its second-longest podium drought at six years, although there was no NCAA tournament in 2020 due to Covid. The last All-American here was Taylor Venz during his freshman year. And outside of TJ Dudley from 2015-17, Nebraska hasn’t had another multi-time All-American. 
I do believe either Pinto or Allred will end that streak this year as I think they both have the ability to land pretty high on the podium. And I expect either one to do the same the following year, possibly finishing on top to end their careers with guys like Keckeisen and Starocci finally out of the picture.
