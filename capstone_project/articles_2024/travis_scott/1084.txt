We've had a great season of Saturday Night Live, with some fantastic moments, from Christopher Walken's Foo Fighters introduction to a very funny Scarlett Johansson's surprise cold open.
If you're here, you might be getting ready to watch SNL on March 30, 2024 and wondering: is it all new tonight? Who's hosting?
The answer ... YES! Actor and comedian Ramy Youssef is scheduled to host, with Travis Scott as the musical guest. And as you can see below, SNL has some big names lined up for future episodes that are coming up soon, with former cast member Kristen Wiig and Ryan Gosling lined up.
