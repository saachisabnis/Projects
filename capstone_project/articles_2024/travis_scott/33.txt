Five years after putting Perfect 10 out into the world, Mustard is readying his next album, Faith of a Mustard Seed. The producer unveiled the album’s cameo-filled trailer on his socials earlier today, which features footage of the project’s potential contributing artists.
“But Jesus said if you had faith the size of a mustard seed…” the trailer opens, as photos of Mustard’s adolescence – as well as his children – flash across the screen, all contributing to the project’s reflective themes.
Throughout the one-and-a-half-minute trailer, artists including Future, Travis Scott, Lil Baby, Young Thug and Don Toliver.
In a later clip, Mustard is seen at the whiteboard, editing a list of presumed featured artists, with other names including Roddy Ricch, Megan (Thee Stallion) – presumably, NBA YoungBoy, Kid Cudi, J. Cole and DaBaby.
While the aforementioned artists are yet to be confirmed, it’s unlike Mustard to not deliver a stacked and star-studded release. A release date, too, has yet to be confirmed, though the project is set to surface some time this summer.
