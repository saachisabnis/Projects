Original Story: A key storyline in the sneaker world heading into 2024 was the arrival of Travis Scott’s first signature shoe with Jordan Brand — the Jordan Jumpman Jack. After years of producing many of the label’s most popular releases, it is finally time for him to premiere his very own sneaker. Highlighted within Hypebeast’s preview of the 24 most exciting sneakers of 2024, its “Sail” colorway remains the target of many sneakerheads as we near its debut.
Adding to the list, a new pair has just been unveiled, sporting “University Red” at its Swooshes, the tongue’s Jumpman logo and the embroidered Cactus Jack face logo at the heel. Similar to the aforementioned “Sail” pair, a textile base is joined by leather overlays with this colorway utilizing black and white at the two areas respectively. Its signature midfoot strap is also featured in white leather while the sole unit pairs a white midsole with an off-white outsole.
At the time of writing, no release details regarding Travis Scott’s Jordan Jumpman Jack silhouette have been disclosed by either party. Hang tight as we await updates from La Flame as the new sneaker is expected to release in the coming months via Nike SNKRS and select retailers.
