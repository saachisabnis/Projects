Travis Scott has one final gift for fans this holiday season with the release of his Air Jordan 1 Low “Velvet Brown” this weekend. 

	Ahead of the dark mocha Cactus Jack kicks hitting retailers, La Flame connected with Dennis Rodman for an Air Jordan x Cactus Jack commercial supporting the “Velvet Brown” release. 

	Scott and the former enigmatic NBA star’s relationship has come a long way since Rodman called Travis out for “copying” his DR sneakers with the signature backward swoosh Nike logo.

	Taking a page out of Willy Wonka, a fan discovers a golden ticket inside their shoe box meaning they’re taking a trip to — not the chocolate factory but the North Pole’s Cactus Jack sneaker factory. 

	










	Shot from the fan’s first-person point-of-view, they enter the magical workshop and see the inner-workings of La Flame’s genius creations. They’re greeted by none other than Dennis Rodman, who plays the role of tour guide on the expedition.

	Rodman puts the car into overdrive and they slam into Scott’s personal office — startling him while he’s hard at work. “Dammit! Damn Dennis, it’s the third time this week, bruh,” Trav said before greeting the lucky fan. “Oh what’s up? Welcome to the factory.” 

	A limited number of fans will be lucky enough to find the earthy tones of the Cactus Jack sneakers under their Christmas trees this holiday season. The Air Jordan 1 Low “Velvet Brown” are live on the Cactus Jack website and are set to be available on the Nike SNKRS app and Nike website come Saturday morning (Dec. 21) at 10 a.m. ET for $150.
