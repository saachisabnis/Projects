Future and Metro Boomin are back together on their second collab album, We Still Don’t Trust You, which dropped Friday (April 12) via Freebandz/Epic Records/Boominati Worldwide/Republic Records.

We Still Don’t Trust You arrives three weeks after We Don’t Trust You, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and featured the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single “Like That” with Kendrick Lamar. The track struck a chord with a lot of rap fans (as well as Drake and J. Cole) for the “Motherf–k the big three, n—a, it’s just big me” line, which prompted Cole’s response on “7 Minute Drill” from the Dreamville MC’s surprise Might Delete Later project. At his own Dreamville Fest April 7, he walked back his claims and referred to the diss track as “lamest s–t” he’s done in his entire life.

	










We Don’t Trust You featured other notable guests such as The Weeknd, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti and Rick Ross. The 17-track LP opened with 2024’s second largest week by equivalent album units earned, behind Beyoncé‘s Cowboy Carter. It also marked Metro’s fourth No. 1 album and Future’s ninth.
