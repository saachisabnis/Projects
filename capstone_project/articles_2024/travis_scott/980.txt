Geto Boys rapper Scarface has been reportedly admitted into intensive care. At the moment the reason for his hospitalization is unknown. The rapper jumped on social media to share the news with his fans. In a picture posted to Instagram, Scarface lies on a hospital bed while nurses tend to him. He wrote a very cryptic message, only adding to suspicion about what he’s dealing with. 
“Ouch… [three prayer hands emojis] Grateful.” Fans and peers alike hopped in his comment section to share their support. Everyone from Krayzie Bone and Travis Scott to academic and author, Marc Lamont Hill wants to let Scarface they’re in his corner. DJ Quik told the rapper (real name Brad Jordan) that it was not his time, and they still had work to do. “Brad, we got more work to do bro bro. Ain’t no time to be out of time.”

Mannie Fresh and E-40 also showed their support. “[prayer hands emoji] let’s go BRO WE GOT THINGS 2 Do,” Mannie Fresh wrote. Whereas, E-40 wishes him a “speedy recovery.” Twista and Warren G even chimed in offering their own well wishes. “God watch, protect, and heal my brother,” Twista commented. Warren G kept it simple, writing [prayer hands emoji] Get well homeboy!”
Scarface health hasn’t been the best over the last few years. The Houston Chronicle reports that in 2020 he was diagnosed with COVID-19. After a year of battling complications from COVID-19, he eventually went into organ failure. Luckily, in 2021, his son, Chris donated his kidney to the rapper. In other news, the rapper recently fired shots at streaming platforms. In his opinion, hip-hop culture has become “f*ckin’ dumbed down.” He added, “So these muthaf*ckas don’t look like me, they’re not creators of this culture, but they want to control it.”
