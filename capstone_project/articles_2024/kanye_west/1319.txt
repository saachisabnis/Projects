Kim Kardashian opened up about the struggles of parenting solo after her divorce from ex-husband Kanye West. 
“I think you and I’ve mostly connected on parenting,” Kardashian, 44, began during the Tuesday, November 12, episode of friend Zoe Winkler’s “What the Winkler?” podcast. “And judgment, and feeling like sometimes you’re in this alone, even though we have great support systems and we have people around us.”
Kardashian noted that although she often struggles or feels overwhelmed, she does so silently in fear of outside reactions. 
“But sometimes in the middle of the night,” she continued, “when they’re all sleeping in your bed kicking you and crying and waking up — it’s not something that I talk about a lot because I feel like there is always a lot of judgment or people always will jump to the, ‘Oh, but you have the resources to have nannies and to have help.’ And I just think that no matter what kind of help I have, I’m basically raising four kids by myself.”
Kardashian​​ and West, 47, share daughter North, 11, son Saint, 8, daughter Chicago, 6, and son Psalm, 5. She filed for divorce in February 2021 after nearly seven years of marriage; the proceedings were finalized in November 2022.
West has since moved on with Yeezy architectural designer Bianca Censori. Us confirmed in October 2023 that the two had tied the knot “for religious reasons.”
Kardashian, despite her rarified lifestyle, supervises everyday mom things, like getting the kids ready for school.
“I mean even carpool this morning, I had five kids that I had to take,” she told Winkler, 44, who’s the daughter of actor Henry Winkler. “And everyone wants to leave at, like, different times or wants different stuff. And I feel like I’m at, like, a pit stop of a race car driver.”

Kardashian’s little ones seem to appreciate how she takes care of them. On her birthday in October, North gifted her mom a gold-and-diamond necklace, while all came together to make her balloons with Polaroids attached — and her face glued to them. On the back of the photos, her kids wrote notes. 
“You are a flower to me,” one read, while another featured “Happy birthday, I love you, Mom.”
Kardashian, who showed off the gifts via Instagram, also received a bedazzled Balenciaga purse featuring a small shoulder strap, silver hardware and a pink keychain. “You know when I see a crystally bag, it’s heaven for me,” she gushed via her Stories.
