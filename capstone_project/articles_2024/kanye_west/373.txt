Waka Flocka stirs controversy during a recent appearance amid his continued support of disgraced former President Donald Trump.
On Monday (July 1), Flocka performed at Club Sky in Salt Lake City, Utah. However, it wasn’t his chart-topping set that garnered attention—it was an announcement he made before the concert.
“All Joe Biden voters, get out of my concert,” he said in a video clip circulating on TikTok, instructing fans who support President Joe Biden to exit left.
The statement prompted an uproar of booing from the crowd but garnered significant support from viewers on social media, many of whom rushed to the comment section to express their approval.
“I always liked Waka, but damn a whole new level now 😊😊😊,” wrote one user.

A third user wrote: “Did I just become a Waka Flocka fan? Yup!”

It’s worth noting that Waka Flocka’s support of Trump has been inconsistent.
In 2015, Flocka tweeted, “Fuck Donald J. Trump,” and in 2017, he wiped a his butt with Trump jersey while on stage. However, by the fall of 2023, the rapper appeared to have endorsed Trump despite previous criticism, swapping his profile picture to a side-by-side photo with the 2024 presidential candidate.

The endorsement sparked debate, prompting the 38-year-old to return to Twitter/X where he clarified his stance, writing: “I’m not a politician and I don’t wanna talk politics,” he wrote. “I only answer to the people that made me and that’s my FANS aka THE PEOPLE… I love y’all with every bone in my body man Squaddd.”
