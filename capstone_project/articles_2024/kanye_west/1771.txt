Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, returning to Dodger Stadium on November 16-17, is set to celebrate its 10th anniversary. What started as a collection of ideas in a notebook belonging to Tyler Gregory Okonma, aka Tyler, The Creator—Los Angeles’ own rapper, producer, and creative powerhouse—has evolved into one of the city’s most eagerly awaited festivals.
In 2012, Tyler debuted Camp Flog Gnaw as the OFWGKTA (Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All) Carnival, in a parking lot at The Novo Theater with an intimate crowd of around 2,000 die-hard fans. The event was a bold experiment: a mix of carnival rides, Odd Future-branded treats, and performances by Tyler’s friends, including Lil Wayne, Trash Talk and Action Bronson, among others. It was unconventional, chaotic, and a bit rough around the edges, but it laid the foundation for something much bigger.
As the festival gained momentum, Tyler teamed up with Goldenvoice, the team behind the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, to scale up his vision. With their support, Camp Flog Gnaw grew into a multi-day, immersive carnival and concert, drawing fans from all over the world. The venue shifted to larger spaces, finally landing at Dodger Stadium, where tens of thousands of fans now gather each year to experience Tyler’s world: a surreal, genre-bending fusion of hip-hop, indie, R&B, jazz, and whatever else catches his eye.
Today, Camp Flog Gnaw represents not only Tyler’s vision but also a piece of Los Angeles’ cultural identity, bringing together diverse crowds for an experience filled with surprise guest appearances, pop-up clothing stores, experimental set designs, and boundary-pushing collaborations. Tyler curates each lineup himself, carefully selecting artists who reflect his distinct, eclectic taste and love for artistic fusion. This year’s lineup includes Action Bronson, André 3000, The Alchemist & Friends, Amelia Moore, Blood Orange, Concrete Boys, Daniel Caesar, Denzel Curry, Playboi Carti, Doechii, Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Faye Webster, FM Mood: A tribute to MF Doom, Kaytranada and more.
As we celebrate this 10-year milestone, we look back on five moments that have made Camp Flog Gnaw history.
One of the earliest landmark moments in Camp Flog Gnaw’s history came in 2013, when Tyler brought together the original Odd Future crew, including Earl Sweatshirt, Hodgy Beats, and Left Brain. This reunion was a nod to the collective’s roots and reminded fans of the group’s raw, irreverent energy that first put Tyler and his friends on the map. Odd Future’s reunion at the festival had a nostalgic and chaotic feel, amplifying the festival’s rebellious spirit and cementing its legacy as an event rooted in authenticity and community​.
In 2016, Kanye West made a surprise appearance during A$AP Rocky’s set, performing “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1.” The performance electrified the crowd, bringing together fans of both artists and creating a legendary moment in Camp Flog Gnaw’s history. Kanye’s surprise appearance marked the festival’s rise as a platform where major artists feel at home, popping up for unforgettable collaborations that go beyond what most festivals offer. Tyler, known for drawing in A-list talent for unexpected performances, set a high bar with this moment, which became one of the most talked-about highlights of that year.
In 2018, Tyler fulfilled a long-standing dream when he brought out Kid Cudi, an artist he has openly idolized throughout his career. Together, they performed some of Cudi’s iconic songs, creating a powerful, emotional experience that resonated deeply with the crowd. Tyler’s admiration for Cudi, who was a pivotal figure in shaping alternative hip-hop, was palpable, and fans could sense the mutual respect between the two artists. This heartfelt collaboration became a defining moment in the festival, symbolizing the evolution of Camp Flog Gnaw as a space not just for entertainment but also for genuine artistic connections.
In 2019, fans at Camp Flog Gnaw buzzed with excitement over a special guest slot during the Sunday night finale, hoping for a rare appearance by Frank Ocean. Tyler has always reserved a slot for special guest performers year after year, and it’s anyone’s guess as to who it could be for. Shortly after 10 p.m., Tyler, The Creator took the stage to stoke the crowd’s excitement, saying, “Can I bring a couple friends out?” A$AP Rocky appeared first, performing two songs, followed by Lil Uzi Vert with two more. Both sets were well-received, but whispers of “Frank” still circulated through the crowd. Then, Drake took the stage, starting with hits like “Going Bad” and “Energy.” He checked in with the audience before continuing, saying, “If you want to keep going, I will keep going tonight” where the crowd responded with a couple of cheers but mostly boos and hard no’s. The crowd’s reaction became mixed as some fans held out hope for Ocean. Chants of “We want Frank!”  started to spread among sections of the audience, leading to boos as Drake’s extended set wrapped up. With his usual professionalism, Drake addressed the crowd, saying, “It’s been love,” before abruptly exiting the stage. It stands as a moment that sparked widespread online conversation about fan expectations.
At the 2023 edition of Camp Flog Gnaw, Tyler delivered what he humorously called his “Ted Talk,” blending music with tongue-in-cheek reflections on his career and personal journey. Taking the stage in his usual eccentric fashion, Tyler jokingly quipped about fans wanting new music, telling them, “Y’all wanted new music? Aw, and I wanted a father, but you don’t get everything.” This humorous commentary set the tone for a lively performance, where Tyler revisited fan-favorite hits like “Yonkers” and “Lumberjack.” He later addressed the festival’s return after a pandemic break, expressing gratitude to the fans who supported Camp Flog Gnaw through thick and thin. The mix of humor, nostalgia, and gratitude gave fans a performance that felt personal and memorable, as Tyler managed to both celebrate his past and honor his growth.
