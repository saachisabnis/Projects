Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign‘s Apple Music account appears to have been hacked by an unknown rapper looking to hijack the excitement for Vultures 3.
A song credited to the all-star duo, as well as an artist named yeixs, is currently available on Apple Music and is called “Vultures 3,” an obvious reference to West and Ty’s two Vultures albums that were released earlier this year.

The track does not feature vocals from the rap icon or R&B singer, but instead finds yeixs rapping in a language that is not English.
Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign and Apple Music have yet to comment on the alleged breach in security and the song remains online at the time of writing.
Kanye has been facing a number of problems of late, particularly in the legal sphere.
He was most recently sued by a model who accused him of “unsettling” behavior during a 2010 video shoot.

The woman, former America’s Next Top Model contestant Jenn An, claims the incident took place on the set of La Roux’s music video for “In For the Kill,” which featured Kanye on the remix.
An alleges that West chose her to be in the video by saying: “Give me the Asian girl.”

He then allegedly strangled her, “rammed several fingers down her throat, continuously moved them in and out, and gagged her to emulate forced oral sex, and screamed, ‘This is art. This is fucking art. I am like Picasso.’”
The entirety of the assault, she said, was filmed but a video was not included as part of the suit. Neither West nor An ended up in the final cut of the “In for the Kill” video.

Shortly before that, Kanye was accused of engaging in lewd sex acts and sharing naked pictures of Kim Kardashian to a former employee in a separate lawsuit.
Murphy Aficionado, who was hired by Kanye as a project manager, was allegedly shown nude pictures of Kardashian, who was by then West’s ex-wife by the rapper who was also wearing a Swastika shirt.

The rapper has yet to publicly respond to either lawsuit, which are just two of many he is currently facing.
