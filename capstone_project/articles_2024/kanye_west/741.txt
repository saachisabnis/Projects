Once upon a time in a land called Twitter, celebrities roamed free tweeting their heart’s delight without a care in the world or the fear of being cancelled. 
It was a magical time to be alive. 
However, the world eventually changed, Twitter is now called X, celebrities walk on eggshells where they once roamed carelessly and, well, Twitter as it was essentially burned to the ground. 
For many of us, some of the most hectic celebrity tweets will forever be burned into our minds from the catty A-list spats to all manners of blunders and the endless ramblings of Kanye West. 
Sadly in this modern age of polished TikTok stars and Instagram influencers, we’ve lost the true essence of what it means to be a celebrity and that, dear friends, is to provide chaos in the best way. Pretty Photoshopped pictures are fine, of course, but it’s much more fun when celebrities don’t reign it in. 
During Twitter’s heyday when the likes of Adele, Rihanna and Lily Allen would tweet unabashed, publicists were no doubt stressed to high heavens daily bracing themselves for the inappropriate posts their super famous clients would bash out on their keyboards. 
Life as a celebrity is much more tame now but, as they say, nothing on Beyonce’s internet is ever truly deleted and the following iconic tweets are just some of the highlights of throwback Twitter moments we just can’t forget. 
Yes, a millennial taught me to Tweet…but just remember that I threw that same millennialâs baby shower. Iâve been around a while. Auntie knows a thing or two.
In defence of Susan Boyle, hashtags were still in the early days and so anyone could’ve made the blunder she did. Well, maybe not but… 
In 2012, the Britain’s Got Talent icon – or her PR team – launched a social media campaign to promote her new album with the seemingly innocent hashtag #SusanAlbumParty. 
Nothing seems out of the ordinary until you sound it out separately – Sus A**l B*m Party. 
It was highly unfortunate but provided days, weeks, and even years of entertainment for us all. 
It’s an important day people. It’s four years since… #susanalbumparty ð pic.twitter.com/zNeR0znfGJ
Perhaps no one was more devastated about Whitney Houston’s death than Wayne Rooney, who shared his heartbreak in a pretty epic tweet. 
‘Whitney has passed away. RIP u will live on forever. Cant believe it. I wanna run to u. Really cant believe this. @.’ 
It wasn’t until March this year that Wayne explained his classic tweet while speaking to Rio Ferdinand on TNT Sports, saying: ‘I tweeted about Whitney Houston when she passed away. I said “I want to run to you”, which is just one of her songs, it’s emotional. I used to love Whitney Houston and I was gutted when she died.’ 
Whitney has passed away. RIP u will live on forever. Cant believe it. I wanna run to u. Really cant believe this. @
When he wasn’t so problematic, Kanye was a Twitter legend giving his followers an unfiltered insight into the very random thoughts in his mind. 
On April 7, 2014, he tweeted: ‘Sometimes I push the door close button on people running towards the elevator. I just need my own elevator sometimes. My sanctuary.’ 
Sometimes, not everything should be said but that was darn funny. 
Few Twitter beefs were as savage as Rihanna vs Ciara in 2011. 
It all kicked off when Ciara appeared as a guest on E!’s Fashion Police and a photo of Rihanna at the Brit Awards popped up on the screen. 
The Like A Boy singer said: ‘I ran into her recently at a party and she wasn’t the nicest and it’s crazy because I’ve always loved and respected what she’s done with fashion. I’ve ran into her before, but this time it wasn’t the most pleasant run-in.’ 
Rihanna tweeted right after the show: ‘My bad ci, did I 4get to tip u? #howrudeofme.’ 
As fans grabbed their popcorn and refreshed their Twitter feed, Ciara responded: ‘Trust me Rhianna u dont want to see me on or off the stage.’ 
Trust me Rhianna u dont want to see me on or off the stage
Delivering the ultimate blow, Rihanna ruthlessly replied: ‘Good luck with bookin that stage u speak of.’ 
The bad blood didn’t last for long though as the two reconciled almost immediately before the night was done.

Despite their 72-day marriage, there were some happy moments between Kim Kardashian and her second husband Kris Humphries. 
But sometimes, couples can overshare as evidenced in this June 2011 tweet from Kim to her future hubby: ‘I’m a slave for you… @KrisHumphries.’ 
As the world knows, Kim married the NBA star in August that year in a lavish wedding but they quickly filed for divorce after a little more than two months of marriage. 
I’m a slave for you… @KrisHumphries
One of the most embarrassing Twitter blunders ever was a tweet and delete from Rita Ora. 
In 2014, a tweet was posted to her account that read: ‘Dropping my new song Monday if this get 100,000 retweets.’ 
However, the momentum was lacklustre to say the least and only received 2,000 likes before being deleted. 
Rita then claimed her account had been hacked and she had nothing to do with said infamous tweet. 
She later explained in new tweets: ‘By the way my Twitter got hacked somebody is threatening to release new music I’ve worked really hard on.
‘Nothing comes out until I’m ready.
‘When it’s ready we will drop music! Luckily I caught the hacker really quickly and deleted the post. Thank you!!’ 
By the way my Twitter got hacked somebody is threatening to release new music I’ve worked really hard on. Nothing comes out until I’m ready.
Dionne Warwick is more of a modern Twitter legend but there’s absolutely no way she wouldn’t be included on this list. 
At the age of 83, Dionne has consistently shown the younger generations a thing or two about providing entertainment on X. 
On one November day in 2022, she felt inspired to tweet: ‘I will be dating Pete Davidson next.’ 
It was clearly a thirsty time for Ms Dionne as just two months before, she cheekily wrote: ‘I just heard about Leonardo DiCaprio’s 25 year rule. His loss. You don’t know what you’re missing.’ 
I will be dating Pete Davidson next.
I just heard about Leonardo DiCaprioâs 25 year rule. His loss. You donât know what youâre missing.
There’s probably no suitable explanation that could justify why Kris Jenner felt compelled to inform her followers of this in 2012: ‘I feel like there’s a giant meatloaf inside of me.’ 
It’s open to interpretation, of course. 
I feel like there’s a giant meatloaf inside of me
We still have questions as to why Harry Styles was using Deep Heat anywhere near where he pees but it’ll probably remain one of life’s many mysteries.
In 2011, he told fans: ‘Just used Deep Heat then went for a wee…A mistake has been made.’ 
Talk about learning the hard way! 
Just used Deep Heat then went for a wee…A mistake has been made.
In episode 279 of Cher not giving two flying monkeys what she says on social media… 
The two pop titans were never the best of friends and Cher poured fuel on that fire in 2011 when a fan asked how she spent Madonna’s birthday, to which she replied: ‘I got a colonic.’ 
Never change, Cher, never change. 
Ed Balls Day was officially declared on April 28, 2011 when Ed Balls randomly tweeted his own name. 
It led his followers to believe he was actually searching his name but accidentally published it as a tweet instead. 
The Good Morning Britain presenter was a good sport about it and now recognises the ‘holiday’ every year.

50 Cent wasn’t best pleased when, after all the fame, money and success he’d acquired, his grandmother still made him take out the rubbish bins. 
Sharing his frustration with his followers, he brilliantly tweeted: ‘I can’t believe my grand mothers making me take out the garbage I’m rich f**k this I’m going home I don’t need this s**t.’ 
No one can humble a celebrity like a straight-talking grandma. 
Omg Katie Price aka Jordan and her husband Peter are on my flight home from NYC!
It was a strange day when Hollywood royalty collided with, well, our very own Katie Price. 
In 2009, a starstruck Kim tweeted: ‘Omg Katie Price aka Jordan and her husband Peter are on my flight home from NYC!’ 
It wasn’t until 2016 that Katie actually replied, writing: ‘@KimKardashian awe that is so cute! Thankyou Kim #Flashback.’ 
Life with unfiltered Twitter was truly a time to be alive.
