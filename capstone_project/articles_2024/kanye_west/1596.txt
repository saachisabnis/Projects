It looks like Kim Kardashian is taking fashion inspiration from Kanye West’s wife, Bianca Censori.
The Skims founder took to Instagram Monday to show off her figure in an oversized brown fur coat paired with black tights and pointed high heels.
In true Censori style, she put her assets on display sans a shirt or pants.
Kardashian, 43, even copied the Australian model’s signature slicked-back hairstyle as she hid behind sunglasses.

Several fans rushed to the comments to question the mom of four’s new look with many referring to her as  “Kim censori.”
“Kim what are you doing?!?!” one person wrote.
“Ok, she is acting like Brianca [sic] right now,” another chimed in as a third added, “Inspired by Censori 😂.” 
“Why is she trying to look like Kanye’s wife?” a fourth questioned.
Kardashian’s latest ‘fit is oddly similar to Censori’s go-to fur looks, including her head-turning outfit from over the weekend.
On Saturday, the Yeezy architect, 29, stepped out wearing a massive brown fur coat styled with black tights and heels while out to dinner with Kanye, 46, and his daughter North, whom he shares with Kardashian. 
She also styled her hair back in a bun and wore light glam.
Her conservative look was a switch-up from her normal barely-there ensembles, as Kardashian reportedly told her ex-husband that she doesn’t like the way the model dresses around their four children: North, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4.
“Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that,” an insider told the Daily Mail. 
Despite the reality star not being Censori’s biggest fan, the two have spent some time together while supporting Kanye at his “Vultures” listening party in San Francisco earlier this month.
They appeared to not have much to say to each other as they engaged in brief conversation throughout the concert.
