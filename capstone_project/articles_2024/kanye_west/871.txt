A birthday wish to Ivanka Trump appeared on Kim Kardashian’s Instagram story as the former’s father battles it out in the days leading up to the presidential election.
“No one sweeter than you Ivanka Trump. Happy birthday,” Kardashian captioned a photo of the pair.
The image was posted Wednesday evening as Trump celebrated turning 43 years old. Kardashian rang in her 44th birthday last week.
Kardashian fans and critics speculated on whether the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star’s post had any political implications as early voting is already underway for Donald Trump’s run against Kamala Harris to be the nation’s 47th president.
The consensus appears to be that it was simply a birthday wish, but having nearly 360 million Instagram followers brings a lot of attention to nearly everything Kardashian puts online.
Also on Wednesday, a YouTube channel belonging to Kardashian’s 8-year-old son, Saint West, was deleted after negative remarks about Kamala Harris appeared on the page. Kardashian shares four children with ex-husband Kanye West, who has enthusiastically expressed affection for Donald Trump.
Kardashian herself has visited Trump at the White House when he was president to push for criminal justice reform. In April, the reality star and mogul met with Vice President Harris to champion the same issue.
