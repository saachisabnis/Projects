North West has a style inspiration...and it's not her mother Kim Kardashian! 
The 11-year-old recently spoke with Interview Magazine for their 55th birthday cover issue, revealing whose style she looks up to the most and why. North, being interviewed by Kardashian, detailed her love for '90s fashion and singled out a few of her favorites in the game. 
"Tyler, The Creator; my dad; me."
North continued to speak highly of her father, Kanye West, during the interview, explaining that the "best day of her life" was during a trip to Italy with the "Waves" artist and her siblings where she helped them find God. 
North is such a fan of Tyler, The Creator's fashion that she plans to recreate a few of his most iconic outfits for Halloween this year in addition to: 
"... a sailor pirate and a mermaid with my two besties. Shout out to them. And I’m going to be Kai [Cenat] and Tyla. I’m going to be Nicki Minaj, and then I’m going to be Princess Peach and Princess Daisy with Chi."
Kardashian shared a series of pics to Instagram following the interview that depicted her daughter living her best life at the photo shoot in a variety of '90s inspired fits.
