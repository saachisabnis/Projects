Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) acknowledged — but did not condemn — white supremacist attacks aimed at his wife, Usha Vance, over her Indian descent on Friday.
“Look, I love my wife so much. I love her because she’s who she is,” former President Donald Trump’s running mate told Megyn Kelly on her SiriusXM show.
“Obviously, she’s not a white person, and we’ve been accused — attacked — by some white supremacists over that,” he continued. “But I just — I love Usha. She’s such a good mom, she’s such a brilliant lawyer and I’m so proud of her.”
Trump’s vice presidential pick, who has faced backlash for going after “childless” Democrats in 2021 with a comment he recently called “sarcastic,” added that his wife’s experience has helped give him the perspective that it’s “very hard” for working families in America.
His comments come after Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who once dined with Ye (the artist formerly known as Kanye West) and Trump at the Republican presidential nominee’s Mar-a-Lago estate, attacked Usha Vance earlier this month.
“Who is this guy, really? Do we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and named their kid Vivek is going to support white identity?” Fuentes said.
Usha Vance, a lawyer and child of Indian immigrants, could become the first Indian American to be second lady if the Trump-Vance ticket wins in November.
Critics on social media questioned JD Vance’s defense, including Kaivan Shroff, a Democratic commentator who shared the clip of the Ohio senator and called it “such a weird” and “pathetic” way to respond to the attacks.
