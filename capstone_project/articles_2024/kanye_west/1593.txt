Lana Del Rey seems to be buddying up with Kim Kardashian! During a group interview with the reality star at the 2024 Met Gala on May 6, Del Rey's extravagant headpiece didn't seem to discourage Kardashian too much from interviewing with the singer.
Del Rey's impressive Alexander McQueen headgear, inspired by the Yellowjackets Antler Queen, commanded attention with its elaborate gold veil and wide wingspan. The SKIMS founder, meanwhile, made her iconic ascent up the museum steps in a custom Margiela by John Galliano gown that prioritized fashion over function.
Once Kardashian joined Del Rey for an interview, the "Summertime Sadness" singer's towering headpiece became a logistical challenge. As the songstress adjusted her headgear, trying to face Kardashian, she humorously struggled to keep her large hat from nudging the reality star repeatedly. Despite this, Del Rey, 38, attempted to discuss sisterhood: "I feel like we have sister corset shapes," she quipped, as Kardashian tried to avoid the jabs from the large headpiece.
Fans were quick to comment on the interview of the two celebs, posting things to X (formerly Twitter) like, "The way Lana Del Rey keeps whacking Kim and Sean in the face with her horns," and "PIss the way Lana is completely unaware almost hits Kim when she turns."

Kardashian, 43, alongside her sisters Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, and Mom Kris Jenner, embodied this year's "Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion" theme with her sheer, lace-trimmed dress complemented by natural waves and subtle makeup. She wrapped herself in a simple gray shawl, allowing her ensemble to shine.
The pair's dual interview at the gala comes after Del Rey spent the Super Bowl hanging out with Taylor Swift and friends at the Super Bowl earlier this year. Kardashian and Swift, 34, have a notoriously long list of beef dating all the way back to 2016, involving Kardashian's ex-husband Kanye West and his controversial song "Famous."
West claimed that Swift had approved the contentious lyrics in the song, which the pop star denied. The conflict deepened when Kardashian released selectively edited footage of a phone call between West and Swift, leaving out West's mention of the specific lyric, "I made that b--ch famous."
