Kanye West has been named an “enemy of Ukraine” after the controversial rapper visited Russia amid the ongoing war between the two countries.
West took a trip to Moscow over the weekend to celebrate the birthday of Yeezy fashion designer Gosha Rubchinsky, becoming the most high-profile western artist to visit Russia since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Because of the trip, the rapper has been added to a list of “enemies of Ukraine” on Myrotvorets, a website set up by politician George Tuka which details people it claims “have signs of crimes against the national security of Ukraine, peace, human security, and the international law.”
A translation of Kanye’s addition to the list says: “Propaganda of war. Visit to the capital of the occupiers during the invasion of the sovereign territory of Ukraine. The money spent by Ye in the so-called Moscow by taxes will be spent on the murder of civilians of Ukraine. Hidden support for aggression and murder of civilians of Ukraine.”
Other high-profile people on the list include boxing legend Roy Jones Jr., former Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters and actor Steven Seagal.
Ye has not yet publicly commented on his trip to Russia or his status as an “enemy of Ukraine.”
West has been seen several times since he landed in Russia.

A large crowd of fans were waiting for him outside of his hotel in Moscow, while he was also seen chilling on a yacht and on the Moscow Metro during his brief visit.
It has been rumored that the Vultures star was planning a large-scale concert in the country, although this has not been confirmed by the rapper or government officials.

It was also speculated that West would meet with President Vladimir Putin but no evidence of an encounter has yet emerged.
Kanye has compared himself to the politician in the past, calling himself “Young Putin” in his Drink Champs interview and adding: “Culture is an oil. Culture is an energy, and I’m the king of culture for the past 20 and the next 2,000 years.”
