Diddy has been facing numerous issues, as multiple sexual assault allegations and lawsuits have been launched against him. While it was believed that Diddy was attempting to remain out of the light while he resolves those issues, that was proven false as the producer popped out to Rolling Loud in Los Angeles. 
The producer was recently spotted making his way through the festival crowd this past Thursday, along with his kids and an entourage of people. 
The move is a shock as Diddy and Kanye previously traded words with one another over West’s “White Lives Matter” t-shirts.
