Kim Kardashian shared sweet new snaps with her and ex-husband Kanye West’s four children after recently claiming she is raising them on her own.
“life lately,” the reality star, 44, captioned an Instagram slideshow on Monday.
The first photo in the carousel was a black-and-white group shot with daughter North, 11, son Saint, 8, daughter Chicago, 6, and son Psalm, 5.
Kardashian and her little ones posed with her mom, Kris Jenner — and all six of the family members matched in pajamas patterned with the matriarch’s face.
Following multiple selfies, as well as a picture of her car and her belly button ring, the Skims creator shared two photos with her youngest daughter.
She and Chicago cuddled up on a couch, with Kardashian wearing a black hoodie and Chicago rocking purple Hello Kitty PJs and white cat ears.
The “Kardashians” star concluded the social media upload with another three-generation snap with Jenner, 69, and her brood.
The Hulu personality became a mom in 2013 when she and West, 47, welcomed North.
Saint was born two years later, with Chicago and Psalm arriving via surrogates in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Kardashian filed for divorce from the rapper in February 2021 after seven years of marriage, and the duo reached a settlement in November of the following year.
The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum cried over their co-parenting dynamic in December 2022 — the same month West married Bianca Censori.
“It’s really f–king hard,” she confessed to “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast listeners at the time.
While appearing on “What in the Winkler” earlier this month, Kardashian admitted that she feels “in this alone” and is “basically raising four kids by [her]self.”
The businesswoman noted, “It’s not something I talk about a lot because I feel like there is always a lot of judgment. People will always jump to the, ‘Oh, but you have the resources to have nannies and to have help.’”
