Kanye West is inviting Bay Area fans to come on out and listen to his latest album.
The controversial, multiplatinum-selling rapper — who goes by Ye these days — is having a listening party for his latest platter on March 12 at Chase Center in San Francisco.
Fans will get to hear the new album that West collaborated on with fellow rapper Ty Dolla $ign — “Vultures 1” — at the event, which begins at 9:30 p.m. The music will be delivered via “a hi-fidelity audio experience,” according to a news release.
And, no, we don’t have any clue what that means either.
What we do know is that tickets for the “Vultures” listening party go on sale at 12 noon March 6, ticketmaster.com. Ticket prices, however, are not being listed on the site.
It’s unclear whether West will be in attendance at this event, but he has appeared at other previous “Vultures” listening parties. It’s also unclear whether Ty Dolla $ign will show up or not.
Previous “Vultures” events have featured a number of guest appearances, including from North West (Ye’s daughter with Kim Kardashian), Offset, Kodak Black, Lil Durk and Freddie Gibbs, according to the New York Post.
“Vultures 1,” which topped the Billboard 200 after hitting stores in February, is the first in what appears to be a trio of “Vultures” releases from the two rappers. Volumes 2 and 3 are reportedly set to be released in March and April, respectively.
