Kanye West and Bianca Censori are reportedly looking to start a family.
The rapper currently shares four children with his ex-wife Kim Kardashian. Relationship expert Louella Alderson told The Mirror that Kim's past experience with a blended family may affect her outlook on her ex-husband's plans.
She explained: â€œKim is from a blended family with half-sisters and step-brothers and sisters. She has an extremely close relationship with Kendall and Kylie, from Kris Jenner's marriage to [Caitlyn], and she also felt like [Caitlyn] was a father figure in her life. This positive experience of growing up in a blended family may help Kim feel more at ease with the idea of Bianca and Kanye starting a family together."

Moreover, The Kardashian stars are known for their large, and often dramatic, family. She's expressed publicly her desires to continue that legacy with a large family of her own. With four children, she's already off to a great start, but her own siblings total six. Kanye's additional children may keep her kids surrounded by an even larger support network. Louella said more siblings could be "a positive step," from Kim's point-of-view.
That being said, Kim is likely to make sure the situation is healthy for her own children. Louella explained: "Kim will put her children first and will want to make sure they are adjusting well to having a stepmother and possibly new half-siblings. Kim will want to ensure Kanye is still investing time and energy into their children's lives and co-parenting with her effectively."
It's possible, according to Louella, that Kim may have "some initial concerns or reservations" with how Bianca will be involved. Plus, Kanye may need to prove "to be a responsible and involved father to their children while starting a new family." While throughout their split Kanye has still kept in touch with his children, especially North West who he supported in her musical endeavors, he is also riddled with legal issues and controversy.
"As long as Kanye is showing up for the children he shares with Kim and being a present father, Kim will probably continue to support their relationship and the positive influence Bianca brings into their lives," Louella added.
