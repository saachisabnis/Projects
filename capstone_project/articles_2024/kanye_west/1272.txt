Kanye West has admitted to feeling he is the greatest rapper of all time as he hit out at Drake in a now-deleted social media post.
The rant on Instagram followed reports of an argument between Kanye and his wife Bianca Censori. The post saw the rapper also take aim at Kendrick Lamar as he went off on a tangent.
Kanye wrote: "Everyone knows I washed Kendrick on no more parties in LA. Everyone knows I washed Drake at the Free Hoover Concert." The gig he was referring to was his 2021 co-headliner with Drake at the Larry Hoover Benefit Concert which was meant to signal the end of their long-running beef.

Kanye then continued as he hit out at sportswear brand Adidas who he famously ended his working relationship with following his antisemitic comments. He continued: "Everyone knows I brought Adidas into this culture and took them out."
Kanye also slammed other names from the world of fashion, including his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, Balenciaga creative direction Demna, and deceased Off-White creator Virgil Abloh. He wrote: "Everyone knows Lotta, Demna, Virgil, Jerry, [and] Kim all worked for me."
He then reeled off a back catalogue of some of his biggest hit records such as My Twisted Dark Fantasy, The Life of Pablo, Graduation, and Watch the Thrones before he claimed he is the "greatest of all time." He concluded: "I am the only person to come back number one after cancellation," before stating, "There is only one GOAT. I stand by me. My friends call me Ye:)."
The rant appeared to have been inspired by Kendrick calling out Drake and J.Cole as he rapped "Mother f**k the Big Three, itâ€™s just Big Me," referring to J.Cole's verse in the First Person Shooter where he named himself, Drake and Kendrick as the GOATs of rap.
Meanwhile, Bianca's sister has slammed reports of a rift between her family members and Kanye. Angelica claimed: "It's all just bulls**t." She also tore down rumours surrounding her family's take on Bianca's new husband, saying that "nothing" reported on their thoughts and feelings about the Vultures musician is true.
"We all support him. We support his new album," she told the Herald Sun. "We support his new clothes he's dropping." Angelina called Bianca her "best friend and confidante" during the tell-all interview, adding: "It's all just bulls**t. There was something about my dad even recently. My dad never talks. Nothing's true," she concluded.
