Katt Williams has responded to Ludacris with his own fiery freestyle laced with some salacious lines.
The comedian made an appearance on Suge Knight‘s Collect Call podcast on Tuesday (January 16) and premiered his lyrical response during the episode.

Luda had earlier dissed Williams in a freestyle over Kanye West’s “Devil In a New Dress” after the Friday After Next star made disparaging comments about him during his viral interview with Shannon Sharpe.
“I’m coming for your number one spot, one of us a killer and the other one is not/ One of us the realest and the other one a fraud,” Katt raps on the hook.

He continues: “You heard the interview on ‘Club Shay Shay,’ I gave ’em all a payday/ I’m still going fucking viral so who care what the haters say/ Ludacris, you must be out your rabid ass mind/ You made a rap song but, n-gga, you ain’t say I’m fucking lying.”
Elsewhere in the freestyle, Katt Williams calls Ludacris “bicurious” and implies he slept with Quincy Jones: “I’ve never personally been with Quincy Jones, but you/ That was your girl girl, boy boy.”
Listen to the freestyle at the 19:25 mark below.
The back-and-forth started when Katt Williams appeared on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast earlier this month and claimed Ludacris landed his role in the Fast & Furious franchise by making a deal with the Illuminati.
“So there was a crossroads where we were both invited to an Illuminati thing, and it had to be one or the other of us and decisions had to be made,” he said. “So it was both of us, we were equal. One of us had to cut off all their hair and couldn’t do the sideburn thing no more, with the points.”

He added: “And the next person they said was going to get $200 million because they were going to pay him $10 million a movie to do 20 movies. And that’s how the conversation happened. One of those persons turned out to be Ludacris, and the other person turned out to be Katt Williams.”
Williams then made things more personal by saying the rapper “ended up with a light-skinned ugly-face wife.”

Shortly after, Ludacris hit back with his aforementioned freestyle in which he shut down Williams’ Illuminati claims.
“Never been Illuminati, only Ill-Luda-nati/ And I only left with bitches when coming from any party/ Now I’m married with kids, the evolution of life/ Never been a clout-chaser, never say shit for likes,” he rapped.

He also referenced Williams’ alleged history of drug use: “R.I.P. John Singleton, you never have to flex when you earned every one of your ‘Fast & Furious’ checks/ Afro with the sideburns, yeah that’s my signature/ Addiction’s on the rise, comedians check your temperature.”
