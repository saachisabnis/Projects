It's a combination of people you'd ever expect to be in the same room as one another, but after one of his many Great North Run wins, Sir Mo Farah partied with stars from Geordie Shore at a Newcastle night club.
This time 12 months ago, Olympic legend Mo was relaxing after finishing his last ever Great North Run, after crossing the line first at the famous half marathon from Newcastle to South Shields six years in a row in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. And it was after his victory in 2017 that Mo headed to well known nightspot Tup Tup Palace in Newcastle city centre.
The club is well known for being the scene of plenty of action in the early days of Geordie Shore and two stars from the MTV show, Kyle Christie and Aaron Chalmers were at Tup Tup at the same time as Mo, with the pair and their friends joining him for a picture. A spokesperson for the club told ChronicleLive that Mo was 'on the waters' all night and was happy to have his picture taken with anyone who asked, with many people shocked to see him there.

Tup Tup has hosted plenty of major stars over the years, including Kanye West, 50 Cent, Ed Sheeran and Girls Aloud and at the end of this week, will enter a new era, when it re-opens its doors following a transformation inside, with the club shut to customers for the last few weeks to allow for the makeover to take place.
With Mo absent from the elite men's field, this year's Great North Run was won by Abel Kipchumba, who took an early lead and pulled ahead of his rivals, to finish nearly two minutes ahead of the chasing pack.
The women's race was won in dramatic circumstances by Mary Ngugi-Cooper, who clinched victory by just one second, with JohnBoy Smith and Jade Hall take the titles in the wheelchair races.
