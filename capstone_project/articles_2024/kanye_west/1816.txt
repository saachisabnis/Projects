(Reuters) -Adidas said on Wednesday its second-quarter revenues in North America, excluding sales of the Yeezy line, increased from last year, driven by growth in both wholesale and its own retail.
Including Yeezy, the currency-neutral sales in North America – Adidas’ second-biggest market behind Europe – fell by 8% to 1.3 billion euros ($1.51 billion) in the April to June period.
“The decline was solely related to the significantly smaller Yeezy business,” the company said in a statement, without specifying how much the sales increased excluding the product line.
In a turnaround led by CEO Bjorn Gulden, Adidas has sought to clear remaining Yeezy stock after a bruising break-up with rapper Kanye West, who goes by Ye, while striving to boost its brand through its popular retro styles.
Its quarterly currency-neutral sales rose 19% in Europe to 1.9 billion euros, from 1.6 billion euros a year earlier.
Adidas had hiked its full-year guidance for the second time this year and reported preliminary second-quarter results above expectations in mid-July.
