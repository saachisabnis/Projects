North West never passes up an opportunity to play around with Kim Kardashian — even when it’s in diamond form.
Kim, 44, took to Instagram to show off the gifts her kids got her for her birthday on Monday, October 21, including a gold-and-diamond necklace from daughter North, 11.
“North got me this diamond necklace that says Skibidi Toilet,’ Kardashian said while cracking up and zooming in on the engraved charm. “Wow!” The pendant was set on a gold chain covered in more diamonds.
North then cut in to add that the pendant also said, “Love, North,” on the back, along with the date. She also explained to her mom that she chose the engraving because she “loves” Alexey Gerasimov’s YouTube series, Skibidi Toilet, which for the uninitiated, follows a fictional war between human toilets and robots.
“I do?” Kardashian laughed as she questioned her daughter, whom she shares with her ex-husband, Kanye West. (Kardashian and West, 47, are also the parents of sons Saint, 8, and Psalm, 5, and daughter Chicago, 6)
“Yes!” North confirmed.

Elsewhere on social media, Kardashian shared that her littles came together to make her balloons with Polaroids attached — and her face glued to them. On the back of the photos, her kids wrote notes to their mom. “You are a flower to me,” one read, while another featured “Happy birthday, I love you, Mom.”
Kardashian was also gifted a bedazzled purse from Balenciaga featuring a small shoulder strap, silver hardware and a pink keychain. “You know when I see a crystally bag, it’s heaven for me,” she gushed in the snap.
Kardashian’s gifts didn’t stop there. She showed off extravagant flower displays from her friends and family, a life-size body pillow of herself and a fur purse from Chrome Hearts, which North will no doubt want to borrow one day.
