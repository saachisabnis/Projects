NORTH WEST: I’m going to say, “What’s up? It’s—” [Laughs]
KARDASHIAN: Yeah, say whatever you want.
WEST: Interview? That’s what it’s called?
KARDASHIAN: Yeah.
WEST: “What’s up? It’s North West, and we’re here at my Interview magazine shoot?”
KARDASHIAN: Yeah.
WEST: Go now?
KARDASHIAN: Yep. Just say, “Hi. It’s North West.”
WEST: Hey, it’s me, Tyler, the Creator.
KARDASHIAN: [Laughs] Hey.
WEST: Hey, it’s me, Kanye West.
KARDASHIAN: [Laughs] You’re really messing with me, aren’t you?
WEST: No. Hey, it’s me, North West.
KARDASHIAN: Cutie.
WEST: Can I please see myself?
KARDASHIAN: Do we have a mirror that we can put right behind the camera, like how I do my shoots?
CREW: Yeah.
KARDASHIAN: I’m teaching you all the tricks of the trade.
Hoodie, Jacket, and Bag ERL. Necklace (worn as bracelet) and Bracelets Budahood.
WEST: Should I go now?
KARDASHIAN: [Laughs] Okay. If you could live inside a cartoon, which one would it be?
WEST: Barbie.
KARDASHIAN: Why?
WEST: Because I really like Raquelle, and it’s a good show, and I watch it every night.
KARDASHIAN: You do?
WEST: And then I will literally be like, “Yes, I’m a Barb.”
KARDASHIAN: Fun facts about North: Every night when she falls asleep, she needs the TV on, no matter what.
WEST: That’s not a fun fact.
KARDASHIAN: Okay. Do you like being on camera?
WEST: I like taking pictures of myself, but I don’t like when paparazzi do. When I just woke up and there’s so much paparazzi, I’m like, “Yo, I’m going to sue you.” If I’m ready, if I’m not tired, if my outfit’s good, I’m like, “Okay, I could take a picture.”
KARDASHIAN: [Laughs] Okay. Can you tell me a joke?
WEST: What do you mean?
KARDASHIAN: Are there any funny jokes that you tell your cousins, or your friends?
WEST: Well, I make people laugh, but I don’t be like, “Duck, duck, goose.” [Laughs]
KARDASHIAN: What’s your favorite style right now?
WEST: I like streetwear and the ’90s. Tyler, the Creator; my dad; me!
KARDASHIAN: What’s one lesson you’ll never forget?
WEST: To trust god only.
KARDASHIAN: That’s a great lesson. What’s your favorite class?
WEST: I don’t like school.
KARDASHIAN: What about art class?
WEST: I do not like art.
KARDASHIAN: What?
WEST: I like art, but my art class is very annoying. My favorite class is probably Latin.
KARDASHIAN: Good, because you have a Latin test tomorrow. We’re going to study after this. What’s your favorite song right now?
WEST: “I Don’t Love You Anymore” by Tyler, the Creator.
Hat Jean Paul Gaultier.
KARDASHIAN: Who are your favorite three artists?
WEST: Not in order, but Tyler, the Creator; Yuno Miles; and Nicki Minaj.
KARDASHIAN: What do you do to help other people?
WEST: Spread the gospel. Tell them about god, and how problems get solved if they follow his word and his way.
KARDASHIAN: If you started your own clothing line, what would you call it?
WEST: Well, I am starting my own clothing line.
KARDASHIAN: And what are you going to call it?
WEST: North West.
KARDASHIAN: What was the best day of your life?
WEST: Maybe in Italy with Dad.
KARDASHIAN: What were you doing?
WEST: It was just us and my siblings, and that’s when I really brought them close to god, because we had this house and there was these devil statues, and I was like, “Mm-mm, mm-mm, no, girl.” I was like, “We got to pray.” So then I taught Chi and Psalm and Saint how to pray. God really did his thing after.
KARDASHIAN: That sounds like an amazing day. What are you going to be for Halloween?
WEST: I’m going to be Tyler, the Creator. I’m going to be—
KARDASHIAN: How many looks of Tyler, the Creator?
WEST: Two.
KARDASHIAN: You said six this morning.
WEST: No, I’m going to be a sailor pirate and a mermaid with my two besties. Shout out to them. And I’m going to be Kai [Cenat] and Tyla. I’m going to be Nicki Minaj, and then I’m going to be Princess Peach and Princess Daisy with Chi.
KARDASHIAN: That’s my month of planning. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?
WEST: I always wanted to pause time. When I was in class one day last year, I was like, “I want to pause time and get all my work done, and then run out of class and go to Starbucks, and then go around to Japan and then go everywhere!”
KARDASHIAN: Cute, okay. Who is your favorite rapper?
WEST: Yuno Miles.
KARDASHIAN: For real?
WEST: Yes.
KARDASHIAN: Where is your favorite place to travel?
Hoodie Skims. Jeans Balenciaga. Wings Zucker. Necklace Chrome Hearts.
WEST: Japan.
KARDASHIAN: What do you love about Japan?
WEST: Everything. Everybody’s style is on point. Or New York, because the streetwear there is—yes. And New York is really fun.
KARDASHIAN: I feel like you just kind of fell in love with New York.
WEST: Yeah, but Japan is just like, “Ohayo gozaimasu. Konnichiwa.”
KARDASHIAN: If you could only eat one thing for the rest of your life, what would it be?
WEST: Probably cucumbers and salt. I love cucumbers and salt, for real. Or onions.
KARDASHIAN: You love grilled onions. What do you do if one of your siblings is annoying you?
WEST: When they’re annoying me, I’ll just be like, “Yo, get out my room. I’m not feeling this, for real.”
KARDASHIAN: What’s something you’d like to learn more about?
WEST: God.
KARDASHIAN: Me too. Okay, serious question. How is my cooking?
WEST: You haven’t cooked for us in a long time. Last time you cooked was two Halloweens ago.
KARDASHIAN: What did I make?
WEST: Mac and cheese.
KARDASHIAN: And fried chicken and cornbread. I’m a one-trick pony. Is that one meal good?
WEST: It’s good. It’s just that you’re really good at making me cucumbers and salt.
KARDASHIAN: [Laughs] What do you want to be when you grow up?
WEST: I don’t know, because I already do a lot of stuff that I want to be when I grow up. I just want to pursue my careers now.
KARDASHIAN: That’s amazing that you know so young. What would be your fake name?
WEST: I have one. But I’m going to change because nobody believes me. It’s Katie Johnson. When I’m out at Sky Zone with my friends, they call me Katie, but when I look in the mirror for a long time, I’m like, “I do not look like a Katie.” And then I was like, “Okay, I got to change my name.” So I’m telling y’all now.
KARDASHIAN: [Laughs] Okay, that’s it babe! Thank you.
WEST: Okay, bye.
KARDASHIAN: I want a hug.
Hat Jean Paul Gaultier. Necklaces (worn around neck and as bracelet) and Bracelets Budahood.
