Cordae and Joey Bada$$, Real Boston Richey, Sulé, Dave East and AraabMuzik, and more also unleash new material.

	Today is Friday, which means there are a ton of new releases to look forward to from some of your favorite Hip-Hop artists. To help you unwind and enjoy the weekend, check out VIBE’s picks of songs and albums you should hear and add to your soundtrack of weekend festivities.

	Ab-Soul’s Soul Burger is the album that has the world finally paying full attention to one of TDE’s most introspective and lyrically gifted members. Arriving at a time when his profile has never been higher—thanks to the success of recent singles like “Squeeze 1st 2” and “All That”—Soul Burger delivers an audacious blend of introspection, swagger, and raw lyricism that cements Ab-Soul’s place as one of the most complex voices in modern rap.

	










	From the opening moments of Soul Burger, it’s clear that Ab-Soul is in a reflective, almost cinematic mood. “California Dream” serves as the perfect introduction, capturing the duality of his love for his home state, mixed with the struggle and yearning that comes with it.

	One of the album’s key highlights is the hard-hitting “B.U.C.K.O. Jr.,” a standout track that showcases Ab-Soul’s ability to combine sharp storytelling with bold, in-your-face energy. The song is a masterclass in rhythm and wordplay, proving that Ab-Soul’s pen game has only sharpened with time.

	The collaborative moments on Soul Burger are equally impressive. On “I, Myself, Me,” Ab-Soul links up with Doechii for a track that feels like a collision of two unique energies, with Doechii’s magnetic presence providing a counterpoint to Ab-Soul’s more contemplative verses. Meanwhile, “Don Julio” featuring Fre$H is an ode to living life on your own terms, with a smooth, laid-back vibe that contrasts the more intense lyrical moments on the album.

	“Go Pro” brings in Ty Dolla $ign for a whimsical, almost carefree track that adds a lighter touch to the record. With Ty’s signature hooks and Ab-Soul’s clever bars, the song’s playful mood gives Soul Burger some much-needed variety, showcasing the rapper’s versatility without sacrificing his signature depth.

	For pure lyricism, Soul Burger also delivers in spades. “Crazier,” featuring J.I.D., is a lyrical battle of wits between two of rap’s finest wordsmiths. The back-and-forth between J.I.D.’s rapid-fire flow and Ab-Soul’s intricate bars makes this one of the album’s strongest moments, a true masterclass in technique and verbal dexterity.

	










	Closing the album on a high note is “Peace,” which features Lupe Fiasco and TDE President Punch. Overall, Soul Burger is a multifaceted album that proves Ab-Soul is an artist who can hold his own among rap’s elite. Whether he’s spitting bars about personal demons, collaborating with the next generation of talent, or embracing moments of joy and levity, Ab-Soul delivers a rich, diverse listening experience. With this album, it’s clear that Soul Burger is not just a meal—it’s a feast for the mind. 

	A$AP Ferg’s Darold is a record that balances the weight of ambition with the rawness of personal reflection, marking a pivotal moment in his evolution as an artist.

	On Light Work, Ferg teams up with DD Osama, Bloody Osiris, and The Alumni Ensemble of Harlem to give listeners a bold snapshot of Harlem pride. The track’s hard-hitting beat and assertive bars, punctuated by Ferg’s line, “Rollies, Bentleys and Rovers/ The world got colder since we got older,” sets the tone for a record that navigates both the allure of success and the struggles that accompany it.

	In terms of singles, “Thought I Was Dead” and “Allure” (featuring Future and Mike WiLL Made-It) stand out as staples of Darold, blending catchy hooks with a mix of swagger and reflection. Alive serves as one of the album’s most poignant moments, prefaced by a brief dialogue from Harlem icon Dapper Dan. The track pulls back the curtain on Ferg’s mental state, where he confronts dark feelings of guilt and the pressure to find validation.

	Lines like, “Validation, what I used to aim for / Tried to hide the shame with the fame, y’all,” offer a raw glimpse into Ferg’s internal battles, touching on themes of fame’s darker side and the weight of mental health struggles. It’s a standout in its vulnerability.

	Collaborations are where Darold truly shines. The smooth “French Tips,” featuring Coco Jones, is a lush, soulful moment that channels the spirit of ’90s R&B, reminiscent of Brandy’s “I Wanna Be Down.” Meanwhile, the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul, Mary J. Blige, brings her signature emotional depth to both the cautionary “Casting Spells” and the uplifting “Chosen,” elevating Ferg’s storytelling with her unmatched presence.

	










	The album also features a strong lineup of contributors, including Denzel Curry, Elmiene, BLKPRL, and Shay Rock, each adding their own energy to the project. From the high-octane “Messy” to the introspective “Alive,” Darold effortlessly balances the club bangers with tracks that pull back the curtain on Ferg’s more personal side. – PB

	Young Nudy’s “Right Now” is very fun. The energetic production and bright synths create a nice contrast with his southern drawl and calm delivery. As per usual, Nudy discusses a lot of violence but there’s flexes and weed talk galore. There isn’t much depth here and it isn’t needed; Nudy simply knows how to have fun, bring the vibes, and drop a few funny lines as well. 

	There is a nice beat break at the end of the song as well, leading one to believe this is an album cut and there has been attention to detail in how “Right Now” will transition to the next record. That said, we can’t wait to hear what Young Nudy has coming next and how he elevates. – Armon Sadler

	Cordae and Joey Bada$$ delivered rappers’ and rap fans’ delight on “Syrup Sandwiches.” It’s a slow beat, allowing both rappers to get their flows off. The bars are nice, they sound good, but the listener admittedly doesn’t walk away with much. It feels a bit empty. 

	For two rappers who pride themselves on lyricism and storytelling, there wasn’t much here to capture listeners beyond simply sounding good. That is the lowest expectation when it comes to music. This is not to say they aren’t capable or haven’t in the past, but they definitely could have done better here. Nonetheless, it’s a cool song. – AS

	Real Boston Richey’s Richey Rich marks a significant moment in his rise within the rap scene, showcasing the Florida rapper’s growth both in his sound and his vulnerability. 

	










	Following a string of promising singles, including the emotionally charged “Help Me” and its sequel “Help Me 2,” along with the GloRilla-assisted “Get In There” and “The Type” featuring YTB Fatt, Richey Rich delivers on the promise of his unique blend of street storytelling and introspection.

	The album opens with “Pain to Profit,” immediately setting the tone for Richey’s journey from hardship to success. On tracks like “Eye For Eye,” Richey raps, “It’s been a minute since I felt good, but I’m at peace now,” reflecting the growth and peace he’s found amid the struggles. 

	Lil Yachty contributes a guest verse on “Still Gon Go,” meanwhile, “Please” is a standout, as Richey vents his frustrations. “You f**k with somebody I love, I’ll pull a second and a third degree,” he raps, showing his unfiltered emotion and readiness to protect those he cares about.

	The album’s production is diverse, with tracks like “Come Outside (So Sick),” which samples Ne-Yo’s 2006 hit “So Sick,” blending nostalgia with modern sensibilities. The mix of street anthems and introspective moments is well-rounded, with standouts like “Base God,” “No Peace,” “Still Pray,” “Cup Spill,” and “Hiccup” highlighting Richey’s versatility.

	Ultimately, Richey Rich is a project that shines most when Real Boston Richey lets down his guard and taps into his inner thoughts and embracing the emotional weight of his experiences. – PB

	Sulé is back with his second project in eight months, the sequel to his Black Soprano Family debut Written On Wides Corner. The New Jersey lyricist slam dunks once again, delivering sharp flows, impressive wordplay, heavy-hitting punchlines, and endless pop culture references. 

	Benny The Butcher and Fuego Base join him on the triumphant sounding “Trois Sopranos,” trading big bars and bravado over the course of almost three and a half minutes. The true gem in this project, and improvement from the first volume, is the diversity of sonics and infusion of more instruments. There is also the trap influence on “Victor Cruz” and his change of tone on the “My Brother’s Keeper” hook. 

	










	One of the constant criticisms thrown at Griselda rappers and their affiliates is they often rap over the same beats, but Sulé opted to display variety. It showed his versatility and willingness to appeal to all types of rap fans, making this effort another victory under his belt. – AS

	Wolfacejoeyy continued his run of strong records with “Dallas.” While Cash Cobain remains the best at making sexy drill music, Joeyy delivers pretty well himself. His vocals are scintillating and he knows exactly how to approach beats while allowing them room to shine on their own. 

	A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie tried his hand at the sound with Cash on “Body,” and here he sounded even more comfortable, fitting well on the track. 

	He also changed his vocals a bit to sound slightly more brooding and generally lower in volume, which worked. “Dallas” is a win and it will be interesting to see if Wolfacejoeyy ascends like the other sexy drill creators have. – AS

	Finesi may not be a rapper, but he delivers bars over the course of his debut EP Displays Of Funking Madness. The Nigerian artist describes himself as a guy who loves to make music about love and blends rock, jazz, soul, and Afrobeats in order to do so. The standout records are “GGANBU” and “Call My Name (CMN).” 

	Both employ infectious melodies, upbeat production, and “GGANBU” in particular has a brilliant hook. “Crashout” is his most ambitious effort yet, with the backing of several live instruments that make it easy to imagine this playing well in front of a crowd. Finesi provided a high quality offering, as hearty as a plate of jollof and egusi amid a potluck of other cultural dishes. – AS

Dave East and AraabMuzik continue to build anticipation for their forthcoming collaborative album, Living Proof, with the release of their new single, “Percocet.” Following the high-energy “Buss Down,” this track brings a more measured, introspective vibe. On “Percocet,” East paints a vivid picture of his daily life, effortlessly blending street tales with boasts of his credibility both on the mic and in the streets. 

	










	AraabMuzik’s signature production provides a brooding, hypnotic backdrop, allowing East’s lyrics to shine. With Living Proof set to drop on November 15, “Percocet” offers a deeper glimpse into the project, promising a dynamic balance of hard-hitting tracks and hustler’s parables. – PB

	In the wake of the 2024 United States Presidential Election, which saw Donald Trump victorious over Vice President Kamala Harris, Consequence has released a politically charged new single, “What Has America Done,” featuring Chuck D. 

	The track is an unflinching critique of America’s political landscape, with Consequence addressing the disillusionment many feel in the aftermath of the election results. “The results of the 2024 Presidential Election are a reflection of who and where we are as a nation,” Consequence said in a statement accompanying the song’s release.

	 “Like it or not, especially if you’re African American, we must continue to pursue our equalities and make sure we do everything in our power to level the playing field as best we can.” The song serves as a powerful reminder of the ongoing fight for racial equality and justice.

	Chuck D, never one to hold back, provided his own sharp commentary, declaring, “Avatars like they’re the new Klan hoodies… The more things change, the more they stay the SAME!” His words cut through the surface of political change, echoing his trademark call for deeper reflection on America’s social issues.

	“What Has America Done” will be featured on the deluxe edition of Consequence’s forthcoming album, Nice Doing Business With You, set to drop on November 22, 2024. The deluxe edition will also include seven new tracks and appearances by  Kanye West, Chris Rock, and his Cons’ son, Caiden The Crownholder. – PB
