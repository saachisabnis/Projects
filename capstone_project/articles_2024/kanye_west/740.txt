Freddie Gibbs and JPEGMAFIA are embroiled in yet another online beef, this time after the Baltimore-bred artist started calling Gibbs a “p####” on Twitter (X). The online exchange kicked off on Friday (February 23) and carried into Saturday (February 24), with both parties sending petty shots in each other’s direction.
According to fans on Reddit, the discourse between Gibbs and JPEGMAFIA began when they were staying at the same hotel while working on Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s collaborative album, Vultures 1. Not long after JPEGMAFIA tweeted, “If stand on business was a person,” Gibbs—who recently had graphic photos of himself leaked on the internet—responded with, “My ass got more promo than your album.” He then clowned JPEGMAFIA for supposedly not showing up in the hotel lobby and recorded himself having the “longest breakfast ever” to which JPEGMAFIA replied, “your baby mama got the longest throat ever.”
Gibbs also posted a video of himself waking up in his hotel room, soaking in the scenery, eating a delicious breakfast and smiling at the camera. It was soundtracked to Mr. Rogers’ theme song, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” Gibbs captioned the clip, “Howdy neighbor.”

Gibbs took several other shots at JPEGMAFIA, saying things like, “You know a n#### old when he got one earring.” JPEGMAFIA, meanwhile, went on a whole rant in a series of tweets, writing, “And we at the same hotel this n#### so p#### lmao. Bald head p#### b#### ima f### ya mamma n####. Cry harder. I’m still in Milan btw waiting for some gangsta s### to happen. Gang members talking tuff and getting snuffed. Gangsta peg. Never got shot and did nothing, never got beat up, never spread my a## online, baby got no dick dent. I guess I’m the gansta now.”
JPEGMAFIA added, “Spreadie Gibbs too p#### to talk to me like a man. Ye saved u milk dud.” His next video was recorded on the plane and he continued to make fun of Gibbs’ troubles over the years.

Once people began telling him to calm down, JPEGMAFIA went after his white fanbase, saying, “White people misunderstand things and start projecting, why none of this energy in real life? Why wait til im gone to dance in your room. Grown men support n#### who spread they a##hole online and im the corny one lmao yall white kids are losers and your parents money saves u from failing at life.”
He continued, “Your entire race is dense and violent, and stupid as f### why would not talk about the one group of people that f##### up the entire world? How many people have died historically from white mens insecurity. Guess.”
Freddie Gibbs, who’s a master at trolling (just ask Akademiks), seems to have moved on and is back to promoting his work on Vultures 1.
