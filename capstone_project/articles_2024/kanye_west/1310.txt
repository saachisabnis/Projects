Kanye West aired a 30-second commercial for his Yeezy fashion line during the Super Bowl, which he apparently recorded on his phone in the back of a car. Though ads were running $7 million for 30 seconds this year, West’s ad didn’t air in all markets, suggesting he spent a bit less. But he says it paid off, sharing a text from a business associate yesterday that seems to indicate he sold $19 million worth of merch via Yeezy.com after the ad aired.
The four main items in the collection — a top, pants, a T-shirt and YZY pods — are now priced at just $20 (not including shipping). West infamously wanted to price all his items at $20 during his partnership with Gap (and sell them from huge sacks on the floor), but the company refused. Now that his antisemitism has blown up that deal, he can dictate his own prices.
