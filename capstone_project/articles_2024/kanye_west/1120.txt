Lupe Fiasco is thrilled G. Dep has been released from prison, but he’s welcoming the rapper back with a special request.
The Chicago-born MC wants new music from the legendary Harlem spitter born Trevell Coleman, which he humbly shared on Thursday (April 4).

Lupe took to X (formerly Twitter) to send good wishes to the “Special Delivery” rapper, though his thoughts came with a wish of his own, too.
He wrote: “Get G-Dep to the studio immediately! We need that follow up! [face with steam from nose emoji] Welcome Home!”
The Bad Boys Records veteran was released from prison earlier this week. Late last year, the 49-year-old was one of 16 people who were granted clemency by New York Governor Kathy Hochul. Once his sentence was commuted, he became eligible for parole sooner than he would have.
G. Dep’s official Instagram page documented his release and subsequent celebrations, from being greeted with a prayer circle outside Fishkill Correctional Facility in upstate New York to enjoying his first post-prison meal at iHop.

G. Dep’s initial sentence of 15 years to life previously included stipulations that prevented him from requesting parole before the 15-year mark. His clemency grant, however, allowed him to petition the parole board after serving 13 years.
Back in 1993, the then-18-year-old rapper tried to rob someone at gunpoint in East Harlem, New York. The victim, who was later identified as 32-year-old John Henkel, resisted the robbery, leading to Dep firing off three bullets and fleeing the scene without checking on his victim.

Unfortunately, Henkel died from his injuries and law enforcement were unable to solve the murder until the case eventually went cold.  Meanwhile, G. Dep signed a deal with Diddy‘s label and went on to release his debut album Child of the Ghetto, spawning hits such as “Let’s Get It” and the aforementioned “Special Delivery.”
In 2010, Dep finally turned himself in, and was handed the aforementioned prison sentence two years later.
