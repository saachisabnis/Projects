She wrote: “hey i’m gonna deactivate because i’m not really feeling this anymore. you guys take care of yourselves. i like coming here to find inspo and see people being creative but i just feel like this is getting to be too much. the way i’m spoken to on here and treated makes me have fucked up thoughts. Please watch how you talk to and about people on the internet. Bye.”
She also posted a photo of a crab claw holding a cigarette. She captioned that post: “peeeeace.”
Not long before Doja removed herself from Instagram, she made waves on TikTok for a hilarious recital of a viral line from  Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’sVultures 1 track “Back to Me,” which also features Freddie Gibbs and Quavo.
The line, rapped by Kanye and sampled from the 1999 Kevin Smith film Dogma goes: “Beautiful, big titty, butt-naked women just don’t fall out the sky, you know?”

In the clip, Doja tried repeatedly to say the line but kept stumbling and laughing as she struggled with the alliteration.
The “Kiss Me More” rapper has plenty of reasons to celebrate these days, even if she isn’t feeling the love on social media.
