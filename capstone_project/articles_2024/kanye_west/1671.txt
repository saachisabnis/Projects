Members of The Bobby Bones Show shared the first pop culture moment that came to their mind when asked about one! They only had three seconds to write down their answer.  
Bobby Bones shared his was the 2009 VMA’s when Taylor Swift accepted her award and Kanye West ran on stage to interrupt her and said Beyoncé deserved the award. He’s not sure why that’s the first pop culture moment that came to his mind.  Amy’s pop culture moment was also about Taylor Swift, but hers was about her relationship with Travis Kelce. It came to her mind first because she had just seen a video of him at one of her shows.  
Eddie’s moment was when Justin Timberlake ripped Janet Jackson’s shirt and her nipple was shown on TV during the Super Bowl. It changed everything about live broadcasting and is the reason why there is a delay now. Lunchbox’s moment was when Britney Spears had her head shaved and was smashing a car with an umbrella. That’s when he realized something was wrong with her. Morgan’s first moment that came to mind was Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake on the red carpet in their matching denim outfits.
