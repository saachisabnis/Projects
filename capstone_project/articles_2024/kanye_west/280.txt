Ye, the controversial rapper formerly known as Kanye West, hosted a listening party last night for his album Vultures, which still hasn’t dropped yet, at a sold-out United Center in Chicago.
According to numerous reports, the live stream — which was accessible for $19.99 — was promptly cut off after West began chanting, “I’m still crazy, bipolar, antisemite and I’m still the King.”
It seems that despite posting a now-deleted apology to his Instagram, Ye is actually not turning from his antisemitism.
Don’t forget, just four year ago Ye won Grammys and Dove Awards for his gospel album Jesus is King. In 2022, he won every single Christian and Gospel Award for Donda. In stark contrast, his new album Vultures  is laced with profanity and sexual content.
If you want to see the trainwreck for yourself, Ye will be hosting another listening party tonight at UBS Arena. There are thousands of seats still unsold.
