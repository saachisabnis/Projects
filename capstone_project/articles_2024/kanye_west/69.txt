Donna Summers’ estate and Kanye West have resolved a heated legal dispute over West’s unauthorized use of her iconic song “I Feel Love.” Rolling Stone reports that the settlement, termed a “global settlement,” was reached after a copyright infringement claim was filed by Summer’s estate in February.
A status report filed in a Los Angeles federal court on Wednesday revealed that all parties involved have agreed to officially resolve the matter. Stanton L. Stein, the late singer’s estate lawyer, stated, “Plaintiff anticipates that the final settlement agreement can be executed shortly.” This agreement comes after Ty Dolla $ign and Kanye West sampled Summer’s disco hit for their song “Good (Don’t Die),” which led to the filing of a copyright infringement lawsuit.
Summer’s widower, Bruce Sudano, expressed his intent to protect her copyright. He told Rolling Stone that he planned to fight for Summer’s catalog, “I intend to protect Donna’s copyright.”
Despite being denied permission to use the song, West and Ty Dolla $ign proceeded to incorporate it into their track.
The lawsuit claimed that West and Ty Dolla $ign knowingly used the sample without legal permission, indicating willful infringement. Sudano accused them of “arrogantly and unilaterally” choosing to “simply steal” the song. Thus, leading to the estate seeking maximum damages for their actions.
The lawsuit emphasizes the broader implications beyond financial compensation. This highlights the importance of artists’ rights and preventing unauthorized use of creative works. Sudano’s stance on protecting Summers’ legacy aligns with concerns over West’s controversial behavior. This includes past antisemitic remarks and actions that have drawn criticism.
As the legal battle concludes, the settlement brings closure to a contentious issue surrounding artistic integrity and intellectual property rights. Specific details of the settlement remain undisclosed. This resolution marks a significant moment in the ongoing dialogue concerning the ethical use of musical works in the industry.
