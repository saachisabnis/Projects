Tyrese has had plenty of public ups and downs over the past few years, and it looks like he’s now got one more of each to add to his list.
On Sunday (February 11), the actor and singer took to Instagram to share a trailer for his upcoming album Beautiful Pain. Simultaneously, he shared that he had broken up with girlfriend Zelie Timothy because of that very album.

“Me and Zelie just broke up over some dumb shit,” he captioned his post. “She demanded that I cancel my ALBUM because there’s too many songs about my ex on there.. fuck does that even mean?”
The ex in question is Samantha Lee, with whom Tyrese recently went through a “messy and ugly” (in Lee’s words) divorce.
Tyrese began his video by apologizing to Katt Williams, 50 Cent and Kanye West, all of whom he’s had high-profile exchanges with in recent years.
“50 Cent, Katt Williams, Kanye, forgive me. I used you for clickbait,” he said.

The trailer shows footage of a number of stars who, it’s implied, appear on Beautiful Pain. These include Lenny Kravitz, Will Smith, Snoop Dogg, and El DeBarge. It also contains news coverage of the singer’s split with Lee and his mother’s death in February 2022.
Beautiful Pain is available for pre-order for a limited time at Tyrese’s website. The site says that the album will be released in May.

Last year, Ty told Kenny Burns about the album, saying that it was inspired by his troubles with Lee.
“I want to give y’all the heads up,” Tyrese told Burns last February. “For all of the uber-sensitive people. One thing y’all not are gon’ do, whether I’m a man, a woman, Black, whatever — y’all not gonna be able to stop me from speaking, walking and living in my truth.

“And if your brain is triggered by a man having real conversations about his thoughts and his feelings and what he experienced and you look at that as bashing or tearing down someone because they happen to be a woman, then your whole process is wrong.”
He continued: “Because my ex is doing ‘Miracle Mondays’ all over Instagram… taking shots at me every day, called my current girlfriend a jezebel. I just want y’all to keep the same energy with people being able to express themselves. She’s allowed to feel whatever she want to feel. She can use whatever platform she want. She can write a book, do a podcast.”

“I wish her well. But if you can express your thoughts and feelings and play victim, then I can express my thoughts and my feelings through my music, through me writing books, me doing interviews. And you gotta hold that the way I gotta hold that because – it’s work.”
