The Grand Rapids Gold are gearing up for the 2024-2025 season.
To create excitement and get the word out to fans, the Gold spent $100 on Cameo, which is a fun app that lets you buy special video messages from your favorite celebrities.
With the $100 they were able to get some funny and famous people to promote the 2024-2025 schedule release.
The first person you see is a Peter Griffin Impersonator from the popular cartoon show Family Guy.
Next up is "Kanye East" the alter ego of rapper Mike Manik, known for his comedic and absurd rap style that parodies Kanye West.
He gained significant popularity on TikTok starting in 2021, particularly with his viral track "Fortnite Balls".
Darryl Postelnick, known as "Cooking with Darryl," is a popular social media cook and influencer who gained fame on TikTok.
He started sharing cooking videos in 2020, inspired by his daughter, and quickly amassed a large following, currently boasting nearly 3 million followers.
The next face you see needs no introduction, It's Santa!
And the finally Cameo appearance is a man who looks strikingly close to New York Jets QB Aaron Rodgers.
