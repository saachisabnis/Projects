JAY-Z‘s collection of platinum plaques has grown this week, as the rapper received a bevy of new RIAA certifications for his solo work and his joint project with Kanye West.
On Friday (August 23), the Recording Industry Association of America officially bestowed platinum and multi-platinum certification on six of Hov’s most beloved singles. Of those, the only one to earn its very first indication of 1 million records sold was 2000’s “I Just Wanna Love You (Give It 2 Me).”
