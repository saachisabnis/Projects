Juvenile, the Cash Money Records legend, expressed his honor to be part of Kanye West's "Vultures 1" album despite Kanye facing opposition in clearing samples. Juvenile happily approved the use of his classic tune "Back Dat Azz Up" for the song "Do It," appreciating Kanye's support for his indie efforts in the past. Unlike Ozzy Osbourne, who opposed Kanye's use of Black Sabbath's "War Pigs" track, Juvenile considers Kanye a good person and gave the green light for the sample. Juvenile is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his breakout album "400 Degreez" with a digital deluxe rollout and plans for a music video for the title track. He will also perform at the Lovers & Friends Festival.
