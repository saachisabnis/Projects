Doja Cat has hilariously struggled to remember and recite lyrics from Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’sVultures 1 album.
In a video uploaded to TikTok, the rapper attempts to recite a viral line from the duo’s song “Back to Me” which also features Freddie Gibbs and Quavo.

The line, rapped by Kanye and sampled from the 1999 Kevin Smith film Dogma goes: “Beautiful, big titty, butt-naked women just don’t fall out the sky, you know?”
In the clip, Doja tries repeatedly to say the line but keeps stumbling and laughing as she struggles with the alliteration.

Sampling the line from the cult film is one of the few instances of Kanye West not running into trouble with the release of the Vultures 1.
Changes to the album were made after Ozzy Osbourne and the estate of Donna Summer refused to clear samples — and in the case of the later, sue Mr. West.

Osbourne heavily criticized West and refused to let him sample Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man” due to his antisemitic views.
He said: “With the current state of affairs, you don’t need anybody starting people on discrimination of any kind. It’s wrong. It’s just wrong. There’s enough fucking aggravation, and he shouldn’t say anything [like what he has].

“It’s wrong if you don’t say anything about him. I don’t want any of my work in any shape or form to be associated with anything like that.”
Osbourne previously revealed he had refused to clear the sample, writing on social media: “@KANYEWEST ASKED PERMISSION TO SAMPLE A SECTION OF A 1983 LIVE PERFORMANCE OF ‘IRON MAN’ FROM THE US FESTIVAL WITHOUT VOCALS & WAS REFUSED PERMISSION BECAUSE HE IS AN ANTISEMITE AND HAS CAUSED UNTOLD HEARTACHE TO MANY.

“HE WENT AHEAD AND USED THE SAMPLE ANYWAY AT HIS ALBUM LISTENING PARTY LAST NIGHT. I WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN.”
To get around the issue, Kanye replaced the sample with an interpolation of his own track “Hell of a Life,” which was already cleared to use the heavy metal anthem.

Summer’s estate has also sued West for unauthorized use of her classic single “I Feel Love” which was prominently featured on “Good (Don’t Die)” without permission.
According to court documents, the Yeezy boss tried circumventing their decision by using an interpolation instead of a sample. This, the estate said, still counts as copyright infringement.

As a result, Ye, Ty Dolla $ign and the label through which the song was released are all being sued. “Good (Don’t Die)” has since been removed from streaming services.
