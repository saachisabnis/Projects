We’re seeing spots.
Bianca Censori sported one of her usual skintight ensembles in Los Angeles Tuesday, pairing a leopard-print catsuit with a long, plastic-like coat while heading into a meeting.
Kanye West’s wife, 29, wore a baggy beige Balenciaga trench over her animal-spotted onesie.
She finished the look with black leather Miu Miu thong boots ($2,050), wearing her short hair slicked back behind her ears.
The polarizing sandals have also been spotted on Rita Ora, Sydney Sweeney and Kendall Jenner, and fans had mixed opinions about seeing them on Censori.
“Those shoes are so fire,” one tweeted, while another mocked her “ugly ass shoes.”
Censori rocked icy blue eyeliner for the outing, clutching her phone and keys as she left a parking lot.
The look was a far cry from the bundled-up ‘fit she wore during LA’s cold snap last week, with the Australian native sporting a huge black fur hat and a long leather trench coat to ward off the chill. 
Of course, the Yeezy architect — who married the “Gold Digger” rapper in December 2022 —  is known for her body-baring style, having shown off a bevy of bold looks over the past two years.

Earlier this month, she sported a barely-there bikini top with a tiny skirt as she walked barefoot through a Las Vegas casino for her 29th birthday celebrations with West.
In addition to a gushing birthday tribute to Censori, the Yeezy designer shared a scantily-clad photo of his wife on Instagram in early January, with the brunette beauty modeling a fur bandeau and micro-thong.
With plenty of winter left to go, we hope Censori doesn’t catch a cold in her itty-bitty ‘fits.
