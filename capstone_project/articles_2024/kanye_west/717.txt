Eminem has taken aim at Benzino on a new song with Lyrical Lemonade called “Doomsday Pt. 2” — listen to it below.
Reigniting his feud with the former publisher of The Source magazine after originally beefing with him in the mid ’00s, the self-proclaimed Rap God mocks his rival’s financial woes and physical stature.

Over a sample of Em’s classic hit “Role Model,” he raps: “Now I got a riddle, one condition, you mustn’t laugh/ What is the opposite of Benzino? A giraffe/ ‘Go at his neck,’ how the fuck is that?/ How can I go at somethin’ he doesn’t have?
“Arm so short he can’t even touch his hands/ When they’re up above his head doin’ jumpin’ jacks/ Sorry, I don’t mean to upset you, Ben/ When I talk about all the debt you in/ I hear that you been creepin’ on the low/ In them cheap hotels, that they catch you in.”

He continues: “Jesus Christ, dawg, when you said two-ten/ Never guessed you meant at the Red Roof Inn/ In a room with one single bed, two men/ Shady, man, you can’t–, yes, you can.
“Well, I guess then I regret to inform you, hate to spoil the day/ But this doesn’t bring me no joy to say/ Guess that Coi Leray feat is in the toilet, ay?”
“Doomsday Pt. 2” is Eminem’s first shot at Benzino since the height of their feud in 2003 when the media mogul and occasional rapper released a diss track aimed at the Detroit legend.
The Source then released an early demo tape from Eminem recorded in the 1990s that saw the rapper using a racial slur.

Benzino had claimed that the beef was over in March 2022 but has continued to take digs at Eminem in public.
Later that year, he criticized the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for inducting Eminem ahead of Black artists such as Nas and Lauryn Hill and also slammed the rapper’s fans.

Benzino wrote on X, then Twitter: “To all you pussy ass Stans, we all know y’all are the most corniest non violent coward fan base hip hop has ever seen I have a restaurant in Atlanta 5071 Peachtree industrial boulevard Chamblee GA. stop tweeting and pull up on me you pussies.”
He added: “I been left this shit alone but since the COWARD ASS STANS still wanna talk shit and hide then it’s still fuck Eminem and if you got a problem with me, do something about it nothing you ever said has effected me in anyway. I know how to fight and I got big sticks. So pull up.”
Benzino has yet to reply to Eminem’s latest diss.

Elsewhere on “Doomsday Pt. 2,” which appears on the new Lyrical Lemonade compilation All Is Yellow, Slim Shady shouts out J. Cole and Dr. Dre‘s Aftermath label while claiming he had the best verse on “Forever,” his 2009 collaboration with Drake, Kanye West and Lil Wayne.
“And that’s why I’m back with Cole Bennett/ And I been at the level J. Cole been at/ It’s Aftermath that I ride for ’til I die,” he raps to close out the track.
