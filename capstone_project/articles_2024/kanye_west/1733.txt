Christina Hall made a big move by hiring powerhouse attorney Laura Wasser in hopes of finalizing her divorce from Joshua Hall sooner rather than later, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.
“Christina was not happy with the progress or lack thereof,” a source told Us of Christina’s prior representation, noting that the Christina on the Coast star, 41, turned to Wasser to expedite the legal process.
The insider explained that Christina “decided to go with the best divorce attorney out there to try and wrap this up quickly and fairly.”
Christina filed a change of attorney with the Superior Court of California in Orange County on Friday, November 22, according to court docs obtained by Us. She will no longer be represented by Dearmey Law APC.
Christina has “consented” to the substitution of representation as had her new attorney, Wasser, per the filing.
Wasser is a high-profile divorce attorney who is known for representing some of Hollywood’s biggest names. She previously represented Angelina Jolie in her divorce from Billy Bob Thornton in 2003 and later in her split from Brad Pitt in 2016.
Kim Kardashian enlisted Wasser’s help in 2020 when she divorced Kanye West. Some of Wasser’s other A-list clients include Johnny Depp, Christina Aguilera, Ryan Reynolds and Jennifer Garner.
Wasser’s services don’t come cheap. According to a Bloomberg report in 2016, the lawyer charges her clients $850 an hour. Wasser requires a $25,000 retainer fee and mostly represents individuals who possess a net worth of $10 million or more, per the outlet.
“I know I have a reputation for being a pit bull, but really, I’m results-oriented,” Wasser told Dame Magazine in 2012 of her work style. “What you want in a lawyer is someone who really tries to get it resolved out of court, but if it just can’t, then let’s go. Let’s go, and let’s crush.”
Christina’s choice to hire Wasser comes four months after she and Josh, 44, both filed for divorce after being married two years. Prior to Josh, Christina was married to Tarek El Moussa, with whom she shares two children. Her second marriage was to Ant Anstead, with whom she shares son Hudson.
Christina and Josh have been battling over assets and money since they parted ways. Josh initially stated he wanted to evenly divide their assets, including their Newport Beach home and the rights to Christina’s HGTV series.
According to a source, Josh was “offered a seven-figure plus settlement and turned it down.” The insider claimed to Us in August that Josh’s attorney “said it was too low.”
A second insider told Us at the time that the HGTV star “didn’t offer Josh millions,” explaining that they hadn’t “started negotiations.”
Christina and Josh have continued to butt heads over their financial situation. Last month, Us confirmed that Josh requested Christina pay him $65,000 a month in spousal support. Christina filed a response to the request in October, calling it “outrageous.”
“The court is familiar with offers labeled as ‘Good Faith’ settlement offers which are not in fact made in good faith. The claim by [Josh] that he sent a ..Good [F]aith” settlement offer is not a fair characterization in my opinion,” Christina’s lawyer wrote in his declaration, according to docs obtained by Us.

A spokesperson for Josh told Us in October that Christina’s recent filing is “riddled with provably false statements.” The rep’s statement read, “Josh never requested $65,000 in support. That’s false.”
That same month, Josh filed a request with the court to block Christina from selling their Tennessee home, which they have been battling over since the summer. Josh relocated from California earlier this year to live in Tennessee until they reached an agreement.
Christina, meanwhile, has stayed in California, where the estranged couple also own a home.
