Apparently, Shaq and Ye West apparently still have some issues with one another.
On Feb. 13, West put up an Instagram post about Dov Charney, the founder of American Apparel.
“Dov Charney is my brother and me and my wife’s business partner,” West wrote in all caps.
Fifty minutes after the post went up, Shaq entered West’s comments with some surprising hostility but eventually deleted the message.
In 2022, West called out Shaq on X, formerly known as Twitter, after the retired basketball star criticized Kyrie Irving for his antisemitic comments, and he accused Shaq of bullying Irving. He then mentioned Shaq doing business with businessman Jamie Salter.
“Shaq is in business with Jamie Salter,” West said. “Jaimie [sic] first said he’s 50/50 with David Beckham and 50/50 with Shaq. I said ‘Jamie … There’s no such thing as 50/50 in business  … Who has the extra 1 percent for the control and voting rights?”
Shaq responded to the tweet: “Believe me, you don’t know me like that. Worry about your business, and to quote the once great Kanye West ‘I got more money than you, so why would I listen to you’ take my advice get your family business in order. Have a great day, brother.”
