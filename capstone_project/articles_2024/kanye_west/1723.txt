Joe Budden often has a lot of strong opinions on Drake, and he recently claimed that he’s getting intel about The Boy from private escorts.
Drizzy was one of the the topics on the most recent episode of The Joe Budden Podcast, which featured guest Akademiks – who accused the “Pump It Up” rapper of “hating” on Drake over the years.

In his defense, Budden said he’s not hating. Instead, he’s sharing inside information from women who, he implied, Drake and/or his associates may have pillow talked with.
“I think most of my Drake intel today comes from my love of escorts,” Joe said. “I’m not trying to be funny. The escorts just always know. The escorts are ground level to it all. The escorts are the CIA of the subway system.”
Late last month, Joe Budden alleged that Drake was being secretly paid to promote Sexyy Red, as he feels their friendship wouldn’t exist otherwise.
“Respectfully, it sound like a n-gga that could rap at that level that gets paid off of everybody’s deal tryna rap. That’s what it sound like to me,” Budden said on his podcast. “Oh, you think he just like being around Sexyy Red that much? … I can name some more people.”

Shortly after the episode, Red issued a short and sweet response, simply writing on X: “They so dumb.”
Drake also appeared to answer Budden by posting a picture of him on his Instagram Stories along with the caption: “What’s the vibes in NY?”

On November’s Scary Hours 3 (also known as For All The Dogs: Scary Hours Edition),  the Toronto native took aim at not only Budden, but Kanye West and Pusha T as well.
On “Stories About My Brother”, Drake rapped: “Imagine us getting our validation from an ex-musician searching for recognition/ Same story every time, they heckle in repetition/ I’m top of the mountain, these n-ggas still down at base camp, they planning they expedition.”

Budden first earned the Scorpion rapper’s ire back in October, when he critiqued the original For All The Dogs, which didn’t sit well with Drake.
But despite his critique of Drake’s music over the years, Budden had nothing to say about the project or the diss when the topic came up on his show.

“Not a peep,” he said. “Not a one word about it. Not one word. I’m here to listen to y’all. I have absolutely nothing to say.”
Budden went on to say he wanted to “keep my thoughts to myself,” which drew reactions of surprise from his co-hosts.
