Kanye West is reportedly planning to launch his own porn studio and brand. A rep for the rapper stated that he’s determined to enter the industry by creating an adult entertainment division under his parent company, Yeezy. He’s reportedly partnering with porn producer Mike Moz on the venture (who is also the ex-husband of Stormy Daniels.) The project could launch as early as this summer.
Ye’s foray into porn may surprise some, since he famously blamed it for the downfall of his marriage to Kim Kardashian. “Hollywood is a giant brothel Pornography destroyed my family,” he wrote on Instagram in 2022. “I deal with the addiction [and] instagram promotes it.” But a month later, West uploaded a video on YouTube that showed him presenting a pornographic film to Adidas executives during a business meeting.
