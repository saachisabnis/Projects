The Made in America Festival, a hallmark event founded by Jay-Z, has been canceled for the second consecutive year. 
The festival, celebrated over Labor Day weekend along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia, blends performance and hip hop, showcasing Jay-Z’s influence on the music scene.
A statement released on social media explaining why the event would not be taking place in 2024.
“Since its inception, this groundbreaking festival has celebrated music and community – from creating a space for fans to connect, to uplifting local small businesses & shining a light on important causes,” organisers said in a statement.
