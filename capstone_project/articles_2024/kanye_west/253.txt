On Friday, March 15, an allegedly unauthorized YZY GAP merch pop-up in Los Angles was shut down. The merchandise was reportedly stolen from Ye and led to the early closure of the pop-up due to suspected theft. 
The pop-up was run by Urban Necessities and SRGN Studios which took to Instagram to initially promote the pop-up. The advertised that each piece would be selling for $20 USD and will be available on a first-come, firt-serve basis. They boasted that the sale would include “OVER 60K UNITS [of] UNRELEASED YZY GAP” pieces. However, the pop-up was closed shortly after opening. A video of the current Yeezy CEO, Dov Charney, best known as the founder of American Apparel, informing customers in line that the goods were stolen has been circulating online. The video sees Charney voicing, “This merchandise has been stolen from Ye, formerly known as Kanye West,” before being escorted away. Ye appears to have agreed with Charney, later posting the clip to his own Instagram stories. 
Hours later, Urban Necessities and SRGN Studios posted a collaborative post and statement on their social media. They confirmed how they received the products stating, “We work with brands, consignors, partners, and clients from all over the world. We only deal in products that are fully authenticated from vetted sources. The YZY Gap Collection is no different. LAPD has investigated the fraudulent claims and have fully exonerated us from any allegations of misconduct. Thank you to our community of supporters, stay tuned for what’s next…” In a statement from the LAPD reported by Complex, the police reported, “On March 15, 2024, around 10:30 a.m., a radio call was generated for possible theft suspects on the 3800 block of S. Hill Street. Comments of the call stated suspects were selling stolen merchandise at the location. Additional units were requested due to a large group creating a disturbance. Detectives and officers investigated and it was determined to be a civil dispute only.”
