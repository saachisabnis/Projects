Kanye West has clapped back at ex-personal assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, after she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the rapper on Monday. 
In the official filing, the ex-OnlyFans model also accused the Heartless hitmaker, 46, of wrongful termination as well as breach of contract.  
West - who also goes by Ye - has now claimed that the former Yeezy employee, 35, was fired due to 'lascivious and unhinged' conduct and had also demanded a whopping $4 million salary. 
A legal representative for the music artist claimed to TMZ in an article published on Tuesday that Pisciotta's allegations are 'baseless' while also accusing the media personality of 'blackmail and extortion.' 
'In response to these baseless allegations, Ye will be filing a lawsuit against Ms. Pisciotta, who actively pursued him sexually to coerce employment and other material benefits, then engaged in blackmail and extortion when her advances were rejected.'

Kanye's rep also alleged that Lauren stole the star's phone in order to try to delete evidence that would contradict claims in her own lawsuit. 
West claimed that his former employee was terminated due to various reasons, including Pisciotta not being qualified for the position, allegedly asking for a $4 million salary and also accused her of 'lascivious, unhinged conduct.'
His team further alleged that along with the large salary demands, she had also requested for expensive and extravagant items, such as a Birkin bag and a Lamborghini.  
His rep also claimed to TMZ that Lauren had sent nudes to the rapper and 'solicited' the star for sex.  
When Kanye refused to follow suit with what she had demanded, his rep told the outlet that Lauren tried to allegedly extort and blackmail him, such as asking for large sums of money before choosing to file the lawsuit. 
'It is evident that Ms. Pisciotta leveraged her association with Ye and his company,' the rep continued.
'And her proximity to him, to seek material gains, clout, and employment through inappropriate means,' his teamed said, further claiming that Lauren has not been truthful in terms of her claims. 
On Monday, it was revealed that Lauren officially filed a sexual harassment suit against the rapper.

In the lawsuit - which was reviewed by TMZ - Pisciotta said West recruited her to work for him at a time she was pulling in seven figures annually via an OnlyFans account.
Pisciotta said West went on to send her several graphic videos and text messages; told her he had been playing with himself to the sound of her voice; and badgered her about the genitalia sizes of her past boyfriends.
Pisciotta said she worked for West from July of 2021 until October of 2022, when he terminated her employment. After they agreed on $3 million in severance, Pisciotta said in legal docs that West never made good on the amount.
In her suit, she accuses West of sexual harassment, wrongful termination, breach of contract and a hostile workplace, according to the outlet.
Lauren said she initially crossed paths with the rapper in July of 2021 at a time when he was working on endeavors in the fashion industry, the outlet reported, citing legal docs.
Pisciotta told the court that she had collaborated with West on a trio of songs from his studio album Donda, which was released in August of 2021.
Pisciotta said she maintained her lucrative OnlyFans account until the summer of 2022, when West requested she get rid of it as he wanted her to have a 'God Like' image.
Pisciotta told the court West offered her a $1 million annual incentive to abandon the profitable accounts, which she agreed to.
West claimed that his former employee was terminated due to various reasons, including Pisciotta not being qualified for the position, allegedly asking for a $4 million salary and also accused her of 'lascivious, unhinged conduct'; seen in March in Inglewood

Pisciotta said in legal docs that West commenced with a series of graphic text messages and videos pertaining to sex, and incorporating scenarios involving raceplay and cuckoldry.
One alleged text sent by West entered into the lawsuit read: 'See my problem is I be wanting to f*** but then after I f*** I want a girl to tell me how hard they been f***ed while I'm f***ing them. Then I want her to cheat on me.'
The outlet cited that West continued with a series of 'REALLY vulgar' communications to his then-employee.
One text sent by West entered into the court docs by Pisciotta, according to the outlet, read: 'Is my d*** racist? It is. This f***ing racist d*** of mine. I going to beat this f***ing racist d*** for being f***ing racist.'
It continued: 'I'm going to stare at pictures of white woman with Black a**es and beat the s*** out of my racist d*** ... beating the s*** out of his big Black c***.'
Pisciotta told the court West would apprise her to when he was playing himself and ask her if she could hear the activity in the background, the outlet reported.
Pisciotta said in legal docs that West 'was fixated on the penis size of her boyfriends,' according to the outlet.
Pisciotta told the court that West often sent pornographic materials to her, on two occasions clips of himself involved in sexual activity with a woman identified as a model.
Pisciotta said in legal docs that at one point, she was earning a rate of $4 million annually serving as a position West titled his 'Chief of Staff.'
Pisciotta said in legal docs that West commenced with a series of graphic text messages and videos pertaining to sex, and incorporating scenarios involving raceplay and cuckoldry; seen in May in L.A. 
Pisciotta's time working for West ended in October of 2022 - the same month his career, reputation and earnings began to nosedive after he made a series of anti-Semitic remarks across multiple media platforms
Not long after the lawsuit came to light, social media users took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share their thoughts, with some coming to West's defense

Not long after the lawsuit came to light, social media users took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to share their thoughts, with some coming to West's defense. 
One typed out, 'I ain saying she a gold digger..,' while another added, 'She just wants his money.' 
Another penned, 'They're coming after all of the black wealth. Watch yourself brothers,' while one shared, 'This is the only way these women know how to make a bag.' 
Lauren's sexual harassment lawsuit and West's response comes shortly after the rapper went silent amid a battery investigation following an alleged incident at the Chateau Marmont involving his wife and twins Mark and Jonnie Houston.
The star allegedly punched one of twins due to claims that Censori had been 'physically and sexually' abused by one of them in April at the iconic hotel in Los Angeles.
The music artist became a suspect in the battery case, and it was later revealed that he got physical with the 'wrong' twin.

Lauren's sexual harassment lawsuit and West's response comes shortly after the rapper went silent amid a battery investigation following an alleged incident at the Chateau Marmont involving his wife and twins Mark and Jonnie Houston; seen in February in Milan 
However, just one month after the altercation allegedly took place, both West and the twins - who own various restaurants and bars in L.A. - have gone completely quiet, law enforcement told TMZ last month in May.
Over the weekend on Saturday, Kanye was seen arriving to meeting in Prato, Italy alongside wife, Bianca Censori, who donned a barely-there bodysuit for the outing.
The Runaway rapper notably oversees the production of his Yeezy clothing brand in the Italian city. 
Late last month in May, the couple - who tied the knot in December 2022 - were seen arriving to Florence less than a year after they were embroiled in controversy following accusations of indecent exposure in a Venice boat ride.
