Lana Del Rey, Doja Cat, and Tyler, the Creator, will headline Coachella’s 2024 festival.
The 23rd installment of the festival returns to the Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, California, on the weekends of April 12-14 and April 19-21. It will also feature Blur and the breakout rap star Ice Spice.
Del Rey last played Coachella in 2014 and was booked for the 2020 edition, which was scuppered by Covid. Other performances include Ice Spice, Sublime, Grimes, Lil Uzi Vert, J Balvin, Peso Pluma, Reneé Rapp, Jhené Aiko, Victoria Monét, Deftones, Bizarrap, and Lil Yachty, with the Gwen Stefani-fronted ska band No Doubt reuniting as part of the lineup after last playing together in 2015.
Doja Cat last performed at Coachella in 2022, and the singer released her latest album, “Scarlet,” in 2023. Tyler, the Creator, has become a mainstay since debuting at the festival in 2011 with his hip-hop group Odd Future, playing solo sets in 2015 and 2018 and appearing last year during Kali Uchis’ set to sing “See You Again.”
Presale begins Friday at 11 a.m. PT, and registration for access to passes is open now at coachella.com. Performances will be live-streamed on YouTube. The music festival is North America’s largest and has already sold all of its 125,000-day tickets.
Also on this year’s bill are Deftones, the Mexican singer Peso Pluma, and Jack Antonoff’s group Bleachers. Dua Lipa and Shakira were both in contention to headline. Ocean canceled on his second-weekend appearance after playing a much-lampooned set filled with pre-recorded vocals and unorthodox gimmicks on the first weekend. There were headliner controversies at Coachella in the past two years, with Kanye West and Frank Ocean both pulling out at the last minute.
