Pusha T has had a love-hate relationship with Kanye West for years, but he recently shared his thoughts on why artists still choose to work with him despite his myriad controversies.
In an interview with Complex, which dropped on Friday (April 26), the “Burial” rapper said that artists still gain a lot from working with the controversial rapper, and it’s a net positive on their careers.

“I believe that there’s a level of visibility that comes along with being next to somebody like Ye,” he said. “At the end of the day, it’s a level of musicality and genius-level production that comes along with being next to him. So you get a lot of things that I think artists are looking for these days in being next to him.”
He continued: “It’s all about the music for me and just making music at a certain level. I’ve been in this game a long time, so it’s about a certain type of hip-hop that I want to make. And truthfully, Ye definitely knows what I like to make, and I only want to be a part of things that I want to do.”

Perhaps infamously, the pair did not part on amicable terms when Pusha T departed G.O.O.D. Music back in 2022.
But in a recent interview with The Download podcast with Justin Laboy, Ye made clear that their perceived love-hate relationship was actually on good terms.

“I just spoke with Pusha the other day. It was good to talk to him. It was the first time talking to him in a couple months. We made good music together,” he said.
The father of four seemed to suggest that he felt betrayed by Pusha for not supporting him during his bitter divorce and custody battle with ex-wife Kim Kardashian, but has since changed his mindset.

“I thought that somehow because I made beats and made music for somebody that when I couldn’t see my children, these people would use their platform. ‘Cause I used my platform on their behalf,” he added.
“Now I realize no one owes me anything […] If you depend on somebody who is not giving you what you need, you’re the one that’s in the wrong.”
