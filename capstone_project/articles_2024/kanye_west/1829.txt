This couple invited their favorite people to their favorite holiday spot for a celebratory wedding weekend.

 Séli and Matthias were teenagers in 2013 when he struck up a conversation with her in their school hallway. “We were 13 and 15,” says Séli. “I was holding a package of gum and he simply asked if he could have a piece. And a few months later, after a few fun dates, we were an official couple, and now, exactly 10 years later, we got married!”

 Matthias chose the couple’s favorite spot, Ibiza, for his proposal. During their annual summer holiday in 2020, he and Séli went for a sunset walk to Es Vedra. “This is a big magical rock in the sea, and rumor has it, it is the third most magnetic point in the world and has long been referred to as the source of Ibiza's inexplicable energy,” says Séli. “There are a few well-known and busy lookout points to the rock, but we know one where there is almost never anyone to be found. And so there it happened: There were white rose petals, a big bouquet of flowers, a bottle of Champagne, a photographer hidden in the bushes, and after the proposal, three of my best friends showed up who had traveled all the way to Ibiza for this moment and had planned everything together with Matthias.”

 Ibiza also served as a natural choice for the couple’s wedding weekend. “It was important for us that we could do everything outdoors, and in a way to show our guests what we love so much about Ibiza,” says Séli. The couple spent 36 months planning their 45-guest wedding for June 17, 2023—including two years scouting locations. “Of all locations we visited, Fincadelica Ibiza was the very last one and we immediately fell in love,” says Séli. “A beautiful green oasis in a typical Ibiza finca style. Modern, yet rustic and casual, but with a special eye [for] interior design and unique features—a very important point, since I am an interior designer!”

 A color palette inspired by sand and stone, plus hundreds of lush white hydrangeas, created a calm, neutral atmosphere, while thoughtful choices about what to include—a bouquet toss, a white-requested dress code—and what to exclude (a wedding cake, a first dance) resulted in a unique and memorable day for the newlyweds and their guests. “Together with Lucette and Kiki from House of Luce, we worked on our dream wedding for over three years,” says Séli. “Without them, we would not have been able to get it to our wishes. Everything went perfectly on the day itself due to their perfectionism and expertise in the field." See every curated detail ahead in images from Danilo & Sharon.

 The luxurious, oasis-like feel of the couple’s venue set the tone for their overall aesthetic, which they describe as “go with the flow, and authentic barefoot luxury.” An earthy, organic color palette of beige, white, and brown created contrast within the couple’s paper suite—which the bride designed.

 Séli chose a “less is more” approach for her hair and makeup. “I wanted my total look to be as timeless as possible, so that when I am 50 and looking back at photos, I still stand by all my choices!” she says.

 The bride’s natural beauty look complemented her statement-making A-line satin gown from Milla Nova. “Since our wedding theme included the color white, I wanted my dress to be notable but without too many frills,” she says. “I only tried three dresses in total and the one I eventually picked was the first one I tried on.” The full skirt was balanced by a high slit and a strapless bodice, which fit the destination’s warm-weather vibe. Séli’s only accessories were her engagement ring and Carat Antwerp wedding band, and a pair of Francesco Russo gold heels.

 The couple requested an all-white dress code for their guests, with the bride’s friends donning a chic collection of white dresses in varied lengths, silhouettes, and fabrics.

 Matthias chose a bespoke beige set from Suit Supply, dark brown loafers, and a contrasting pocket square. Both Séli and Matthias added the same finishing touch: Christian Dior Ambre Nuit fragrance. “Matthias and I always use the same perfume,” says Séli. “So since we both used this scent together on our wedding day, it now even has a more special meaning!”

 Séli’s design work extended from the invitations and logo to the fabric welcome sign and the reception menus. “Fincadelica has a beautiful garden with lots of hidden gems,” she says. “The entire wedding day was mapped out as a kind of route over the entire location, each event at another place, so that the guests were surprised every time.”

 The outdoor ceremony space was anchored by a plush sofa for the bride and groom and natural bamboo folding chairs for the guests. Hundreds of white hydrangeas—one of the bride’s favorite flowers—were draped around the sofa and used to accent the aisle. “As the location is already such a beautiful place in itself, we didn’t want to add too much,” says Séli. “It was important to maintain the serenity of the peaceful nature of Ibiza, especially not blocking the nice view we had as our ceremony backdrop.”

 Matthias and Séli wrote their own vows, which they exchanged during the family-focused ceremony. “Matthias and I both had our little brothers as best man. They both gave a very personal speech during the ceremony, which made the ceremony extra special,” says Séli. Another special guest sat in the front row: “[One of our favorite memories was] having our six-month-old daughter Amelia with us at this special day,” says Séli. “Matthias walked down the aisle with her.” After using music from Italian pianist Ludovico Einaudi for their processional, the newlyweds chose an unexpected recessional—Kanye West’s “Gold Digger.”

 During cocktail hour by the pool, guests sipped on Cava sangria—”a little special twist to the typical Spanish sangria,” says Séli. The bride also included a traditional bouquet toss, sending her tied arrangement of long-stemmed white roses toward a group of friends. 

 “We did so many things different than most typical weddings: didn’t have a wedding cake, didn’t do a first look, and had no first dance simply because we didn’t want to, but we did allow our guests to wear white,” says Séli. “Stay true to yourself as a couple and don’t let typical or traditional wedding things stay in your way. Everything is allowed. Make your own decisions!”

 Guests sat at a single long table, which was covered in white linens and accented with a sand-colored gauze runner and napkins. “[This] created a beautiful flowy effect with the wind,” says Séli. “Using handmade ceramics with statement edges added some playfulness to the table, but the white hydrangeas were the eye-catchers. We used a few large pieces, which created a playful yet modern look, and we added a classic string of small light bulbs above the long table for a romantic and soft effect.”

 The Chef Ibiza created an unforgettable food experience, which included Spanish antipasti guests shared as a starter. “As we wanted our guests to experience Ibiza, we had large pans of paella that were made live,” says Séli.

 After dinner, the couple and their guests moved inside, where a DJ was waiting to start the after-party. “I wore a short lace dress from For Love and Lemons and Matthias wore a white silk blouse with beige Gucci logo printed pants,” says Séli. (Guests donned shirts bearing the couple’s custom logo throughout the weekend.) The celebration went into the early hours of the morning, and finished with a dive in the pool at 4:30 a.m. 

 “There is nothing we love more than sharing our love and joy with the people that we love,” says Séli. “We host dinner parties during Christmas, we organize barbecues during summer, and just love to spend time with our closest friends and family. And for our wedding weekend, we wanted to do that exact same thing—and share our love for Ibiza with them.”
