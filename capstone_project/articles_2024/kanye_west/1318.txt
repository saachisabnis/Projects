Drake has given Joe Budden the one-up over DJ Vlad for his “Big 3” in Hip Hop media, according to Adam22.
The No Jumper host shared a conversation he had with Drizzy in a clip posted to social media on Wednesday (April 17). In it, the 40-year-old explains that he messaged the Canadian superstar and asked him: “Who’s the big 3 of Hip Hop media platforms?”

The internet personality voted for himself, DJ Vlad and Akademiks, adding in his message that “Zesty Budden is dying to be included.”
Responding with eight crying-laughing emojis, the 6 God told Adam: “Nah. You gotta give it to him over Vlad.”
Earlier this month, Adam22 called Joe Budden out on X (formerly Twitter) after the Slaughterhouse MC alleged that No Jumper was floundering.
According to the stats provided by the media and porn figure, his platform is in fact generating double the views on YouTube than The Joe Budden Podcast.

Meanwhile, Budden and Drake have their own history.
On November’s Scary Hours 3 (also known as For All The Dogs: Scary Hours Edition), the Toronto native took aim at not only Budden, but Kanye West and Pusha T as well.

On “Stories About My Brother”, he rapped: “Imagine us getting our validation from an ex-musician searching for recognition/ Same story every time, they heckle in repetition/ I’m top of the mountain, these n-ggas still down at base camp, they planning they expedition.”
The 43-year-old first earned the Scorpion MC’s ire back in October, when he critiqued the original For All The Dogs album, which didn’t sit well with its creator.

Despite his critique of Drake’s music over the years, Budden had nothing to say about the project or the diss when the topic came up on his show.
“Not a peep,” he said. “Not a one word about it. Not one word. I’m here to listen to y’all. I have absolutely nothing to say.”
The East Coast rapper went on to say he wanted to “keep my thoughts to myself,” which drew reactions of surprise from his co-hosts.

Most recently, Budden claimed that he’s getting intel about his adversary from private escorts.
“I think most of my Drake intel today comes from my love of escorts,” he said on an episode of his podcast in mid April. “I’m not trying to be funny. The escorts just always know. The escorts are ground level to it all. The escorts are the CIA of the subway system.”
