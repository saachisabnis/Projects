Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne slammed Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, after the rapper used part of the group’s 1983 live performance reportedly without consent.
“@KANYEWEST ASKED PERMISSION TO SAMPLE A SECTION OF A 1983 LIVE PERFORMANCE OF ‘IRON MAN’ FROM THE US FESTIVAL WITHOUT VOCALS & WAS REFUSED PERMISSION BECAUSE HE IS AN ANTISEMITE AND HAS CAUSED UNTOLD HEARTACHE TO MANY,” Osbourne wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
He continued, “HE WENT AHEAD AND USED THE SAMPLE ANYWAY AT HIS ALBUM LISTENING PARTY LAST NIGHT. I WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN!”
Ye reportedly played the “Iron Man” sample, despite Osbourne claiming he was denied permission to do so, at an album premiere party on Thursday night in Chicago.
Sharon Osbourne, the wife of the legendary rocker, also hit West over the alleged usage, reportedly telling Page Six, “Kanye f—ked with the wrong Jew this time.”
She added that while Black Sabbath normally accepts usage requests, the group had a “special f—king occasion to say no” to the rapper.
The television star also shared a video calling out West, which she captioned with the clown emoji and the hashtags #permissionnotgranted and #ironman.
West has come under fire in recent years for his increasingly antisemitic behavior and rhetoric, causing several brands to drop their partnerships with him. Adidas formally cut ties with the “Donda” rapper in 2022, halting production of his popular Yeezy products, after he made a slew of antisemitic remarks.
His antisemitic statements over the last two years include praising Hitler and blaming “Jewish media” and “Jewish Zionists” for his various controversies.
Talk show host Bill Maher recently declined to run an interview with the rapper because of that rhetoric.
“He’s a very charming antisemite,” Maher said, adding that he made his decision because “I’m not going to contribute to this.”
