Kim Kardashian's mobile game, which captured the attention of millions when it launched in 2014, is set to bid farewell. Glu Mobile, the developer behind the free-to-play sensation, recently announced its end. The game, an instant hit challenging players to ascend the fame ranks from E-List to A-List, mirrored Kardashian's own journey into the public eye.
In a recent user forum post on Wednesday, Glu disclosed that the game's shutdown is approaching. Players who currently have the game installed can continue enjoying Kim Kardashian: Hollywood until April 8, 2024, after which it will be inaccessible to everyone. The app has already been removed from both the Apple App Store and the Google Play store.
For those with VIP subscriptions, an important note from Glu is to manually cancel the subscription before the shutdown. Additionally, players holding K-Stars should probably spend them before the game discontinues.
Kardashian expressed her gratitude with TMZ, saying, "I'm so grateful from the bottom of my heart to everyone who has loved and played Kim Kardashian: Hollywood in the past ten years. This journey has meant so much to me but I've realized that it's time to focus that energy into other passions. I want to thank the Glu team and the many people behind the scenes who have worked diligently on making it a success. I will be forever inspired by this community that we built together."
Financially, the game was a significant success, with CNN reporting a daily revenue of $700,000 shortly after its launch. By 2016, the mobile app had accumulated almost 16 billion minutes of gameplay, according to Business Insider. In a July 2016 Forbes cover story, it was noted that the game had been downloaded 45 million times, generating $160 million in revenue and earning Kardashian an estimated $45 million.
As we bid farewell to discussing in-game tasks as if they were real, spending K Stars on peculiar pets, and navigating the challenges of dating a character named Cletus, it's a nostalgic moment for fans who've been part of this virtual journey.

Kim Kardashian can make you laugh without even trying to. Being an active poster with her daughter North West on their joint TikTok account, Kim and North, the SKIMS mogul often joins in on dance routines and pranks. In November 2021, the mother-daughter duo debuted their TikTok page. Now, the two boast a whopping 16.7 million followers on the social site.
For North, pranking and roasting her mom has long been one of her favorite pastimes. As we previously reported, Kim revealed that her daughter intimidates her more than anyone. The Kardashians reality star, who also shares daughter Chicago and sons Saint and Psalm with ex-husband Kanye West, has called North Kanye's "twin." When it comes to Kim doing unboxing videos for Instagram, North has hilariously called her mom out for her tone of voice. Back in September 2021, North interrupted her mom's makeup haul to ask, "Why do you talk different?" Kardashian replied: “For my videos, I’m the same human being. I don’t talk different. How do I talk different? Guys, do you think I talk different when I’m talking about contour?”
Both North and her cousin Penelope Disick were in the bathroom with Kim, agreeing that she sounds like she is talking in a different tone when talking to her hundreds of millions of followers. When Kim asked the girls how she sounded, North delivered an accurate impression of Kim’s high-pitched voice, with Penelope seen chuckling in the background. Kim posted a collage of folks on X (formerly Twitter) loving North ragging on her mom to her Story, saying things like, “‘You always say you’re glad when you’re mad,’ by Ms. North West,” and “Not North clocking Kim for her business voice.” Kardashian's minimalistic style isn't safe from North, either. Her daughter has complained when Kim wears too much black. “North is very opinionated when it comes to what I’m wearing,” Kim said in March 2022.
Take a look below at Kim Kardashian's funniest TikToks:
In this TikTok video, Kim hilariously shakes as Daniel Caesar's "Get You" is playing. In the short clip, North, as usual, upstages her, but Kim does her best to do a close-up "weird" face for the TikTok.
Using audio from the animated Teen Titans Go! series, Kim hilariously puts her arms up like a cat's. The SKIMS founder then jumps up and down and throws her arms up in the air in the playfully adorable and crazy clip. As if things couldn't be any more chaotic, Kim wears an alien filter perfectly when the audio says: "alien princess."
Though Kim isn't purposely trying to be funny, her attempts at doing a TikTok dance with North is hilarious to watch. Uncoordinated and off beat, Kim kicks her legs out the sides of her black robe and when she crosses her arms to kick her legs forward this time, the combination of all that plus the big sunglasses she wears is absolutely hilarious. To top it off, she tries to adjust her falling hair at the end of the clip.
Here's a TikTok that was meant to be funny... and it actually is funny. North and Kim go back and forth using birds chirping as the audio, in a sassy conversation. North does steal the shine with the dramatics, but Kim's minimal gestures are hilarious in itself.
In this TikTok from February, North hilariously pranks her mom. North opens her mouth up to scream, but when it's Kim's turn, a loud horse neighing plays, which causes her to be embarrassed and hold North as the two laugh. 
Kicking off 2023, Kim gave herself a makeover, er, a make-under with this "British Chav" look. Sharing quick clips of her hair-and-makeup transformation, Kardashian showcased the extremely heavy look, which features her over-lining her eyebrows thickly, and concealer that is shades way too light for her skin tone as she obnoxiously chews gum. The term "chav" comes from a Romany word, "chavi," meaning "child."
