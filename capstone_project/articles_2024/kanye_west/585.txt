Eminem’s new album, The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce), debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart this week. This marks the 11th No. 1 album of Eminem’s celebrated career, as the rapper now ties Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand, and Kanye West for the fifth-most No. 1 albums ever on the Billboard 200, behind only the Beatles (19 No. 1s), Jay-Z and Taylor Swift (each with 14) and Drake (13). 
Three other albums had strong debuts on the Billboard 200 this week, as ENHYPEN’s Romance: Untold comes in at No. 2, Clairo’s Charm reaches No. 8, and Megan Moroney’s Am I Okay? sits at No. 9. Following 12 consecutive weeks at No. 1, Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department falls to No. 4 on its 13th week on the chart. Rounding out the Billboard 200 Top 5 are Zach Bryan’s The Great American Bar Scene dropping a spot to No. 3, and Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time moves down two slots to No. 5. (Billboard)
