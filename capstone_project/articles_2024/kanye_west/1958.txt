North West has just landed her first big role as part of an upcoming Disney+ special scheduled to take place at the end of the month. According to E!News, the 10-year-old standout will play a character in "Disney's The Lion King at the Hollywood Bowl," a live performance taking place on May 24th and 25th. 
North, daughter to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, will join an exciting playbill of The Lion King alums who took part in the production of the original film in 1994. Jeremy Irons, who played Scar, Nathan Lane, who played Timon, Ernie Sabella, who played Pumba, and Jason Weaver, who played young Simba, are just a few of many talented actors set to showcase their skills at the live event during Memorial Day weekend. 
More recent Lion King alums such as Billy Eichner, who played Timone in the live-action version of the film in 2019, and Broadway's The Lion King Musical actors Heather Headley, who played Nala, and Bradley Gibson who played Simba, will join North on stage at the highly-anticipated Hollywood Bowl performance. 
As if the star-studded lineup detailed above was not impressive enough, the show will also feature Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson! E!News mentioned that Disney+ plans to stream the special following the live event, but a date has yet to be announced. The exciting special will feature original songs from the film including "Hakuna Matata," and "Can You Feel The Love Tonight," backed by a glorious orchestra. 
North is extremely passionate about music and in March, revealed that she would be dropping her first album titled "Elementary School Dropout" (a nod to her father's album,The College Dropout, released in 2004) very soon as she continues to follow in her parent's footsteps. Her exact role in "Disney's The Lion King at the Hollywood Bowl," has yet to be revealed as the world waits in anticipation for the event!
