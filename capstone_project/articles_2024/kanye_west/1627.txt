Kanye West and Bianca Censori encountered a confrontation with a stranger captured in a video on Sunday. As they were leaving Melrose Place, a man approached them, hurling insults at Kanye, criticizing him for thinking he's clever. The video shows Kanye and Bianca getting into their Range Rover while the man continues his aggressive rant, discussing topics like God and Lucifer. He obstructs their car, prompting Kanye to stay stationary. During the tirade, the man mentions other artists like Kid Cudi, Jay-Z, Lupe Fiasco, and Mos Def.
He claims ownership of the block, revealing he's been unhoused for 12 years and declares he hasn't listened to Kanye since '07. According to TMZ, Kanye cracked his window to hear the man before driving away. The incident occurred following headlines about Kanye posting revealing photos of Bianca on Instagram over the weekend.
