A 30-year-old Denver, Colorado man is facing life in prison after a federal jury in Cheyenne found him guilty of attempting to entice a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity.
According to evidence presented during his four-day trial, Gabriel Estrada messaged an undercover agent posing as a 13-year-old girl living in Laramie, Wyoming asking if she would have sex with him.
Estrada went on to ask the 13-year-old persona if she had any friends who would like to join them in the sexual encounter and asked about her sexual experience.
After confirming the minor would engage in other sexual acts with him, Estrada drove the two hours from his apartment in Denver to Laramie.
Estrada arrived at the location with physical evidence indicative of his intent to engage in sexual acts with the minor and an iPhone which contained the text messages to the 13-year-old persona.
Estrada testified that he made the decision to drive to Laramie even after the minor told him her age, and said he didn't believe she was 13.
Estrada's sentencing has been set for Jan. 13, 2025. He's facing 10 years to life in prison, up to a $250,000 fine, and five years to a lifetime of supervised release.
