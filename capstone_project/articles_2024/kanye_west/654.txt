Bianca Censori donned a rare conservative look as she arrived in Japan alongside her husband, Kanye West. 
The model — who is known for her barely-there fits — was photographed covered up in a beige flowy maxi dress while arriving at Narita International Airport on Saturday.
She paired her modest look with a black hair wrap.
As for the “Heartless” rapper, he wore a similar white garment over a shirt with a black symbol on the chest.
The pair was spotted arriving at the airport in Florence earlier in the day in the same ensembles, per photos obtained by TMZ.
Censori, 29, and West, 47, landed in Japan after spending a week in the fashion hotspot of Prato, Italy.
It appears the couple spent the majority of their Italy trip focused on business since Censori was seen on June 1 walking into a meeting alongside her husband while holding a sketchbook of designs.
She left little to the imagination for the outing, wearing a white open-sided swimsuit that barely covered her assets.
Since marrying West in December 2022, Censori has turned heads in a series of see-through dresses, sheer tights and more risqué ensembles.
Earlier this month, friends of Censori told Page Six they believe the “Bound 2” rapper is treating her like “some dramatic installation of art.”
We were told that the Australian native was “back to normal” when she returned to her home country recently without her husband.
“It was very obvious to us that she was acting like she was off the clock from a job,” an insider told us, explaining Censori wore a sweater dress for dinner with her parents in Melbourne.
“When you look at all the press [about Censori and West], you would believe she has lost her mind, so it was good to see her with her family and being the person we remembered,” the source added. 
“The clothes were back to normal … there was nothing to suggest her time with Kanye has had a lasting effect.”
