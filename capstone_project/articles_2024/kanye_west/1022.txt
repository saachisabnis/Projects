North West is calling out her mom Kim Kardashian for not cooking much at home.
During a chat for Interview magazine, Kardashian sat down with her 11-year-old daughter to ask her some hard-hitting questions, such as how she feels about the meals she makes at home, per Page Six. 
After Kardashian asked, "OK, serious question. How is my cooking?" North didn't pull any punches with her response, telling her mom, "You haven't cooked for us in a long time." She added, "Last time you cooked was two Halloweens ago" when she made macaroni and cheese. 
The SKIMS founder didn't let her eldest child's response throw her, instead pointing out that she made other foods for the meal in addition to the mac and cheese.
"And fried chicken and cornbread," she said. "I'm a one-trick pony. Is that one meal good?"
North agreed that the meal is "good" but said that The Kardashians star is "really good" at making "cucumbers and salt." She went on to say that it was her choice of snack if she could "only eat one thing for the rest of [her] life," that or onions, to which her mom stated, "You love grilled onions."
In addition to North, Kardashian is a mom to 8-year-old son Saint, 6-year-old daughter Chicago and 5-year-old son Psalm, all of whom she shares with ex-husband Kanye West.
