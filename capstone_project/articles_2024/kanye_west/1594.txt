The Grammy Awards have been recognizing the most talented musicians of the year since 1959.
It's often assumed that all of the legendary hit-makers have taken home a statuette or two — but there are actually quite a few iconic artists who seem to narrowly lose out year after year.
Here are 21 talented artists who've never won a Grammy, ranked by how many nominations they've received.
Nominated 17 times since 1993, singer-songwriter Brian McKnight has yet to win his first Grammy.
He lost his last nomination for best male R&B vocal performance to Prince in 2004.
At 16 nominations, the rapper only trails McKnight by one, but the two have even more in common.
Calvin Broadus, better known as Snoop Dogg, also received his first nod in 1993 and, like McKnight, is still awaiting his first Grammy win.
The Icelandic singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, and DJ has been nominated 16 times since 1993, but Björk has never brought home a Grammy.
She was just nominated for best alternative music album for the 65th Grammys. 
His first nominations were in 2006 for the hit "Every Mile A Memory."
However, even after 15 nominations, country singer Dierks Bentley hasn't won a Grammy.
She's racked up 14 nominations since 1994, but talented country singer Martina McBride has been beaten out each time.
She lost her latest nomination in 2011 to Taylor Swift.
She's been nominated 13 times over the last 10 years, but current "American Idol" judge Katy Perry still doesn't have a Grammy award to adorn her mantle.
Believe it or not, the legendary Diana Ross has never won a Grammy.
Her first of 13 nominations was in 1964 for "Baby Love," and she was nominated nearly every year from 1970 to 1982 without a win.
That being said, the Recording Academy recognized the songstress with a lifetime achievement award in 2012.
From 2010 to 2024, Nicki Minaj has been nominated for 12 Grammys.
The rapper lost best new artist to Bon Iver in 2011, to Kendrick Lamar in all three of her nominated categories in 2015, and to Killer Mike and Billie Eilish for her nominations last year.
Nominated 12 times since 1996, Trevor Smith Jr. aka Busta Rhymes hasn't yet won his first Grammy. His last two nominations were for best rap performance and best rap song in 2011.
He lost to Kanye West in both categories.
Sia has received nine nominations since 2012, but the singer-songwriter, record producer, and music video director has yet to win a Grammy.
She lost her 2017 nomination for best song written for visual media to Lin-Manuel Miranda.
The country singer and judge on "The Voice" has been nominated eight times, but Blake Shelton has no Grammy wins.
He most recently lost at the 62nd annual awards in 2020. 
With six nominations, including one after his death, Tupac Shakur never won a Grammy.
He lost his first nominations in 1995 to Coolio and Naughty by Nature and lost his posthumous nomination to Eminem.
After nearly 50 years of making music, Swedish pop group ABBA landed their first Grammy nomination for their comeback record "I Still Have Faith In You."
The band lost to Silk Sonic's "Leave the Door Open."
Although the group has never won a Grammy, their hit song "Dancing Queen" was inducted into the Recording Academy's Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015. 
The band also earned four more nominations for their 2021 album "Voyage."
Surprisingly, the band Queen received only four Grammy nominations and never had a win.
Even though their last nomination was in 1980, artists like Panic! At the Disco and the 2018 film "Bohemian Rhapsody" are helping to keep their iconic music alive by introducing Queen's music to younger generations around the world.
Another legendary band with only four nominations and zero Grammy wins is the Beach Boys.
They received three nominations in 1966 for their hit "Good Vibrations," and their last nod came in 1988 for "Kokomo."
Although they haven't received a Grammy, The Beach Boys earned a lifetime achievement award in 2001.
Famous for his Las Vegas shows and for being a part of the infamous Rat Pack, Sammy Davis Jr. received three nominations but had no Grammy wins during his lifetime.
He died in 1990, but he earned a lifetime achievement award in 2001.
Jennifer Lopez racked up back-to-back nominations for best dance recording in 2000 and 2001.
However, she lost to Cher's "Believe" and Baha Men's "Who Let the Dogs Out."
It's inconceivable that iconic hip-hop artists Run-D.M.C. have only been nominated for two Grammys.
In 1986 they lost out to Prince for best R&B performance by a duo or group — the hip-hop category wasn't added until 1989. However, they received a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy in 2016.
The iconic hip-hop group has a shot at collecting its first Grammy at this year's ceremony. They were nominated for best film music for "Kings from Queens."
Dean Martin, another Rat Pack crooner, only received one Grammy nomination.
He was nominated for his album "Everybody Loves Somebody" in 1964 but lost to Louis Armstrong.
Although Martin died in 1995, he was honored with a lifetime achievement award in 2009.
It's hard to believe that the former Smiths front man, who's released over 10 albums, has only been nominated for one Grammy.
Morrissey lost out in his 1992 best alternative music album nomination to Tom Waits.
His only nomination was in 1970 for his rendition of "Star Spangled Banner," but sadly, Jimi Hendrix died that same year without winning the Grammy.
In 1992, the Recording Academy gave Hendrix a lifetime achievement award.
