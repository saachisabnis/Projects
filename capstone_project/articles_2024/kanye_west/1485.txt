The VMAs are nothing if not unpredictable.

 Every year, without fail, MTV's Video Music Awards serve as a cultural reset. From Madonna, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears's viral 2003 smooch to Kanye West's infamous Taylor Swift interruption and Miley Cyrus's twerking on Robin Thicke, the night is always full of the most outrageous happenings. In addition to every blink-and-you-missed-it moment, the awards show also has plenty of equally as wild fashion statements. (I mean, who could ever forget Lady Gaga's 2010 meat dress?) The 2024 ceremony was no different. It's an event that will no doubt remain viral for years to come—Sabrina Carpenter getting hot and heavy with an alien alone had the internet losing its mind.

 Ahead, InStyle rounded up everything you might have missed (and need to know about) from the 2024 VMAs.

 Britney Spears, unfortunately, did not make a return to the VMAs stage this year, but she was surely on the mind. Host and nominee Megan Thee Stallion paid homage to the icon by recreating her legendary 2001 look from her “I’m a Slave 4 U” performance. The rapper-singer doesn't do anything halfway—she aced Spears's look to a T, donning the same sexy green bra, metallic hot pants, blue skirt, bejeweled boots, and, of course, a yellow python.

 That's that her espresso. Nobody can get enough of Carpenter—even extraterrestrials. The hitmaker came up for air during a performance of her chart-toppers “Espresso,” “Please Please Please,” and “Taste" to mack a blue alien dancing beside her.

 For her big performance, Carpenter wore a custom creation from Victoria's Secret that took more than 180 hours to embellish and included more than 18,500 crystal beads.

 There was no better person to introduce Katy Perry's performance than her beau, Orlando Bloom. Before Perry ate up the stage (and left no crumbs), the Troy actor gave a sweet, emotional ode: "You fell in love with her as Katy Perry. I fell in love with her as Katheryn Hudson...She loves with her whole heart and it’s kind of irresistible," he gushed.

 What's a tribute without a hot make out session? After Perry captivated the audience with a medley of “Dark Horse,” "E.T.," "Teenage Dream," "I Kissed a Girl," "Firework," and "Lifetimes," that saw her suspended in the air and rolling on the floor, the two locked lips. Bloom also had the honor of passing his wife the Moon Person for the Vanguard Award.

 Chappell Roan is setting the world ablaze as a breakout pop superstar this year, and she couldn't have made it any clearer with her debut VMAs performance. The "Good Luck, Babe" singer showcased her powerhouse vocals and jumped around while dressed in a full chainmail suit. She performed against a backdrop of a castle up in flames and alongside dancers wielding medieval swords.

 In addition to having headline-worthy outfit changes, the "Fortnight" singer loves to have a good time. The 23-time VMA winner was up on her feet for virtually every performance, and even shared a sexy sway with Karol G during her song, "Si Antes Te Hubiera Conocido."
