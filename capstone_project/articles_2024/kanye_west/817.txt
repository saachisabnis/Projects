A Kanye West album autographed by the man himself is being auctioned off for a staggering sum of money — thanks to a certain message he sent adidas while signing it.
The item, a vinyl copy of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was autographed by Ye during a visit to Paris in February and features “FUCK ADIDAS” and “YE” scribbled on the front.

Months later, the one-of-one album has hit the auction block courtesy of Moment in Time and will cost the winning bidder a pretty penny, with the seller seeking no less than $500,000.
Check out photos of the vinyl, along with the moment Ye put his explicit stamp on it, below.
While leaving The Ritz hotel in the French capital back with his wife Bianca Censori, the Chicago rap icon was swarmed by a group of fans who began chanting, “Fuck adidas.”
West was wearing a full mask so it was impossible to see his reaction, but he appeared to endorse the message when he was asked to sign a vinyl copy of his seminal 2010 album.

After appearing to encourage the crowd to chant louder, he took the fan’s copy of the record and signed his name along with “FUCK ADIDAS” on the cover.
At the time, Kanye had been stepping up his campaign against former business partners adidas, slamming them for selling new versions of the 350 shoes which originated under his Yeezy brand.

“Anybody who loves Ye would not buy these fake Yeezys I never made these color ways I’m not getting paid off of them and adidas is suing me,” he wrote on Instagram.
“All these celebrities and the public will stand against a T shirt or the color of my hat but when yall see me have my children hidden from me or see an actual Fortune 500 company rape one of your heroes in real life don’t nobody say nothing or do nothing.”

He added: “As far as the system goes What yall gone do now Take my album down again Freeze my accounts again Threaten people to not work with me again All the new non approved 350’s are cooorny.”
In a separate video, West said: “Let me explain really clearly what’s happening with adidas. ‘Cause not only are they putting out fake colorways that are not approved, they’re suing me for $250 million and they’re also not paying me for the shoes they’re putting out that have my name on it.

“And they using contract clauses and 50 years of business experience to rape an artist. One of y’all favorite artists right in front of y’all in broad daylight.”
adidas terminated their lucrative Yeezy partnership with Kanye in October 2022 after the rapper made numerous antisemitic remarks, with the sportswear giant also freezing proceeds that were due to be paid to Kanye.
