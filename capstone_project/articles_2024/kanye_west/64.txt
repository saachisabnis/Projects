Kanye West, now known as Ye, won a legal battle over a Yeezy trademark registration.
Y.Z.Y., Inc. has withdrawn its attempt to cancel Ye’s Mascotte Holdings’ registration for the YZY word mark for use on footwear, ending their 5-year-long trademark dispute.
Y.Z.Y., Inc. filed a petition to cancel Ye’s registration in 2019, citing prior use of the YZY name before West. Despite several USPTO Office actions, Y.Z.Y., Inc. filed a cancellation petition with the TTAB.
The company has used the “YZY” mark for hair care, skincare, and fragrance products since August 2011, before West used the mark for footwear.
YZY Inc. withdrew its petition, indicating a potential settlement. A co-existence agreement may have been reached, allowing both parties to use their respective YZY marks in the market.
The USPTO examiner viewed Ye’s and Y.Z.Y., Inc.’s goods as related, highlighting that similarity is sufficient to establish a likelihood of confusion. Retail evidence shows fragrances, hair care, and footwear are commonly marketed together, indicating related goods.
Luxury fashion brands are expanding into new product categories, which may lead to trademark disputes. Companies that offer branded merchandise and experiences may face trademark conflicts, which can have significant revenue implications.
Other news reports include the delay of Vultures Vol. 2, the joint album with Ty Dolla Sign, and the cancellation of all future listening events. The sequel’s cover art was released last week, but there is no official word on the release date.
