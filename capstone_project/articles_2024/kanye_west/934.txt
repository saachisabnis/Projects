Jake Paul returns to the boxing ring later TONIGHT (Fri., Nov. 15, 2024) to face perhaps his biggest test to date (if it were 25 years ago) against former Heavyweight champion and one of the baddest boxers to ever lace up the gloves, Mike Tyson, on Netflix.
The eight-round fight will be Tyson’s first taste of action in nearly 20 years, while Paul, 27, was last seen stopping former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)-turned bareknuckle star, Mike Perry, via technical knockout this past summer (video replay here). This fight has significant name value, but whether or it not it equates to the entertainment value is very much a mystery.

Of course, this is all a part of Paul’s traveling circus he’s brought with him since he first decided to dip his toes into the combat world four years ago. During that span, “The Problem Child” has faced retired NBA players, past-their prime former UFC champions such as Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley, and boxers who never made a blip on the radar such as Ryan Bourland.
Tyson, 58, on the other hand, lost his last two pro fights against Danny Williams and Kevin McBride, but that was way back in 2005 (Paul was eight years old at the time). For even more perspective, Star Wars Episode III: “Revenge of the Sith” and Batman Begins were topping the box office charts at that time. In the music world, Kanye West was at the top of his game with “Gold Digger,” while Mariah Carey was atop the Billboard charts with “We Belong Together.” 
In short, it was a long, long time ago.
Nevertheless, this is actually happening (for better or worse), so let’s dive in and take a look the particulars to compare each combatant’s height, weight and other important attributes ahead of their highly-anticipated showdown this evening:
