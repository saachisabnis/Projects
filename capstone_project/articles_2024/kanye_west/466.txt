Festival on 12 to 14 April and 19 to 21 April at Empire polo club will also feature  reunion of No Doubt, as well as performances by Blur and Ice Spice
Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator and Doja Cat will headline the 2024 Coachella music festival, with the Gwen Stefani-fronted ska band No Doubt reuniting as part of the lineup after last playing together in 2015.
Announced on Tuesday, the 23rd instalment of the festival will take place over two weekends on 12 to 14 April and 19 to 21 April at Empire polo club in Indio, California, and will also feature Blur and the breakout rap star Ice Spice.
All three headliners have appeared at the festival in the past. Del Rey last played Coachella in 2014 and was booked for the 2020 edition that was scuppered by Covid.
Doja Cat last performed at Coachella in 2022, while Tyler, the Creator has become a mainstay since debuting at the festival in 2011 with his hip-hop group Odd Future, and playing solo sets in 2015 and 2018. He has also performed in guest appearances at the festival with fellow rappers Earl Sweatshirt and Schoolboy Q, as well as the Latin soul singer Kali Uchis.
Dua Lipa and Shakira were both in contention to headline, according to the entertainment industry publication Variety. Sources told Variety that Lipa had declined because of a timing issue, while festival organisers had passed on Shakira.
Also on this year’s bill are Deftones, the Mexican singer Peso Pluma, and Jack Antonoff’s group Bleachers.
Coachella has been rocked by headliner controversies in the past two years, with Kanye West and Frank Ocean both pulling out last minute. Ocean cancelled on his second weekend appearance after playing a much-lampooned set at the first weekend filled with pre-recorded vocals and unorthodox gimmicks.
The music festival is North America’s largest and has already sold all of its 125,000 day tickets. Three-day passes will be available from Friday at 11am PT as part of Coachella’s pre-sale.
