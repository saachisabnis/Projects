Cordae’s latest album, The Crossroads, is a testament to his growth as an artist, packed with sharp lyricism and star-studded collaborations. 
The Grammy-nominated rapper from Maryland continues to impress with his intricate wordplay, even sparking debate over some of his clever lines. One of the most talked-about moments comes from “Saturday Mornings,” his viral track featuring Lil Wayne, where he raps, “I’m dealing with a lot of problems, don’t know if y’all can relate / Feeling like Rod Wave, I got a lot on my plate.”

While many praised the wordplay as a smart double entendre, some accused Cordae of fat-shaming the multi-platinum Southern rap star. Addressing the controversy on the NFR Podcast, Cordae clarified, “I fk with bro’s music… I’m not fat-shaming; I just think that st’s funny.” 
He revealed that he had even discussed the line with friends before finalizing the verse. Beyond Rod Wave, the album features name-drops of cultural icons like Michael Rubin, Justin Bieber, and JAY-Z, further cementing Cordae’s place in the conversation among today’s elite lyricists.
Since his breakout debut earned him a Grammy nomination, Cordae has steadily elevated his craft and public profile. His relationship with tennis champion Naomi Osaka, with whom he recently welcomed their first child, has added another layer to his narrative. The Crossroads, his third studio album, showcases collaborations with some of music’s biggest names, including Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Ty Dolla $ign, Anderson .Paak, Joey Bada$$, and Jordan Ward.
In the same podcast interview, Cordae shared his thoughts on the ongoing rivalry between Drake and Kendrick Lamar, calling it a pivotal moment for Hip Hop. “It was so phenomenal for the culture; music needed that,” he said. 
He admired how fans dissected the lyrical sparring, celebrating the artistry on both sides. The moment, he added, reaffirmed his belief in the enduring power of meaningful rap.
The Crossroads marks Cordae’s first full-length project since 2022 and reflects his evolution not just as a lyricist but as a collaborator and cultural observer. With each release, he solidifies his reputation as one of this generation’s most compelling voices, blending sharp storytelling with an undeniable ear for standout production.
