DJ Akademiks recently offered Meek Mill a whopping $1 million to do a podcast.
On Saturday (March 16), Meek Mill hopped on X, formerly known as Twitter, and announced that he's looking to secure a podcast deal.
"I want a podcast deal, I have [a] lot to say on many different levels!" Meek wrote in his post, which can be viewed below. "If you have a podcast business moving slow I can reverse that! From - meek mill - I’ve always been my own media and I wanna join the culture of [Black] media!"
DJ Akademiks caught wind of the Philadelphia rapper's post and pulled up with an offer.
"I'll offer you a Million dollars up front for you for 52 episodes 1 a week," Ak typed. "We own video and audio, with a option to renew for a second year. Also we buss down ads 50% on any ads we bring in (Prizepicks, Fashionova etc)."
"You can own the podcast, but we share the IP as long as u in the deal," he added.
Meek Mill didn't respond to DJ Akademiks' offer but he did elaborate on his goals for his proposed podcast.
"Teach the level of business knowledge I know from the streets to being around extreme wealth!" the "Dreams and Nightmares" rhymer wrote on X. "Like how you had the show on Spotify but fueling street beefs I want that type of opportunity!"
DJ Ak responded: "He [don't] wanna box.. maybe he want to podcast..??"
Meek replied: "Yeah just a podcast deal my boy…. I just wanna get in media now and rap…to tell reforms stories about the system let others share their stories and address all propraganda … uplift the [Black] culture … stop beefs publicly .. it’s gonna be called "culture currency."
Meek concluded: "Uplift the culture back where we thrive… I know how to thrive through the good and bad but I think it’s that time we used our voices instead of playing circus!"
