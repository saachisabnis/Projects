Kim Kardashian is sharing what she calls thinks is the saddest part of being a mother.
The Kardashians star took to her Instagram Stories on Saturday (November 9) to share a sad emoji alongside a quote talking about the difficult part of motherhood, per Page Six. Kardashian is a mom to four children who she shares with ex-husband Kanye West: North, 11, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 5.
"The sad part about motherhood is that you're raising the one person you can't live without... to be able to live without you," the quote reads.
The SKIMS founder's vulnerable post comes weeks after a source said Kardashian is "pretty much a single mom" as Ye is allegedly "sadly not around very much" to help raise their kids, per People. 
"Although she has help, it's still a lot of work for her to balance and coordinate everything," the source said, adding, "Kim's life is around her kids' schedules. When they are in school, she works. When they are off, she's very much focused on being a mom."
In September, Kardashian shared photos of her "babies" looking all grown up as they headed back to school. She also shared a photo of the "bizarre" gift her eldest daughter North got her for her 44th birthday last month.
