Kim Kardashian gave birth to her very own personal photographer.
In a recent Instagram post, the Skims founder, 43, posed for a series of sultry photos wearing a gold Prada dress, and revealed that she was lensed by none other than North West.
“✨ 📸 North,” the mom of four captioned the pic, prompting many to comment on the 10 year old’s skills.
“love her creative direction 📸,” said Hulu, the streaming service behind Kardashian’s reality show, “The Kardashians.” 
Another account nicknamed the tween “Northie Testino,” a nod to famed fashion photographer, Mario Testino.
In the artsy blurred photos, Kardashian rocking a slicked back hairstyle, dewy skin, and a form-fitting, sequined Prada tank dress that retails for four figures.
A rep for the brand confirmed to Page Six Style that the gold style costs $7,900, though it’s currently not available to shop online.
“What’s up with the focus?” asked one hater, while another referenced a different celebrity offspring who enjoys being behind the camera. “This is on par with Brooklyn Beckhams photography book 😂”
Still, there’s no denying that Kardashian’s eldest daughter, whom she shares with ex-husband Kanye West, has her own, unique sense of style.
Recently, the Skkn by Kim founder dubbed her child the “stylist of the year” and shared photos of North dripping in Swarovski jewelry, including the brand’s $800 Hyperbola cuff, a thick choker and a nose ring.
North is also no stranger to giving her mom direction for their various TiKTok videos together, and she isn’t shy when it comes to sharing her opinions on Kardashian’s fashion choices, either.
She famously criticized her mom’s pearl-embellished Schiaparelli Met Gala 2023 dress during an episode of “The Kardashians,” telling the star “It’s looking like beachy and the pearls look fake.”
Looks like North will carry the family’s creative business sense into the next generation.
