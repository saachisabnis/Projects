If you were waiting to hear Ye’s latest album, you may have missed your chance.
Less than a week after releasing, Vultures 1 — Kanye West’s collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign — is in the process of being removed from all platforms.
FUGA, the album’s distribution service, released a statement saying that it is working to have it pulled from all streaming services.
Over the weekend, West uploaded the album to DSPs through FUGA’s automated platform. However, the company had already declined to distribute the record. Now, FUGA says they are working directly with streaming platforms to remove the project. At the time of publication, the album has been removed from the iTunes store and Apple Music (although a few singles are still lingering), and Spotify has removed a song that interpolates Donna Summer’s 1977 song “I Feel Love,” apparently without permission.
FUGA spoke with Variety about their decision to remove the album:
“Late last year, FUGA was presented with the opportunity to release Vultures 1. Exercising our judgment in the ordinary course of business, we declined to do so. On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement. Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”
West released distributed Vultures 1 a day after his controversial album release concert in Chicago. During the event, the livestream was cut short almost immediately after West began chanting, “I’m still crazy, bipolar, antisemite and I’m still the king.”
