“We built a really good foundation,” Osaka told InStyle of their parenting together. “I don’t know if it’s because he’s just an easygoing guy, but I think we just respect each other’s opinions. And if we disagree on something, we talk it out. At the end of the day, we both want what’s best for Shai.”
Osaka went public with news of her pregnancy in January of last year and announced that she would be stepping away from her tennis career for 2023, but assured fans her goal was to be back in time for the Australian Open next year.

“The past few years have been interesting to say the least, but I find that its the most challenging times in life that may be the most fun,” Osaka wrote on social media at the time.
“These few months away from the sport has really given me a new love and appreciation for the game l’ve dedicated my life to. I realize that life is so short and I don’t take any moments for granted, everyday is a new blessing and adventure. I know that I have so much to look forward to in the future, one thing I’m looking forward to is for my kid to watch one of my matches and tell someone, ‘that’s my mom’ haha.”
