Kim Kardashian showed off her and Kanye West's four children in a new family photoshoot shared to Instagram on Sunday (December 29), and they're all grown up! 
The sweet carousel features the SKIMS mogul in a stunning, satin ensemble accompanied by daughters North, 11, and Chicago, 6, and sons Saint, 9, and Psalm, 5. The series shone a heartwarming spotlight on family time this holiday season as the group posed in front of a tall white Christmas tree. 
Each child seemed to be all smiles as they enjoyed the holiday season with their mother. North wore a black and white suiting fit aside Saint and Psalm, both in jackets with matching black pants and shoes. Chicago wore red like her mother, looking absolutely adorable in a red leather look complete with matching cowgirl boots! 
As the photoshoot continued, followers were gifted individual snaps of Kardashian with her two girls, two boys, and photos of the children having fun together. 
The exciting series arrives mere weeks after the SKKN BY KIM standout unveiled a mysterious foot injury that landed her in a boot and crutches. Kardashian even attended the SKIMS New York City flagship opening on a knee scooter, and debuted an inventive heel cast soon after. Despite her recent injury, the star looked to be back on both feet just in time for holiday fun with her crew!
