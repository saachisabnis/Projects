With Kanye West’s Yeezy line now fully in the rear-view for Adidas, a new foam clog has emerged as a suitable replacement for the Foam Runner. 
The Adidas Lightblaze Moc is a new casual and comfy footwear option bearing a number of similarities to the dynamic Yeezy shoe. The newer model’s mold features quite similar lines to the Foam Runner, albeit in less rounded form. And the two colorways that have leaked thus far feature multicolor marbling, which was a hallmark of Yeezy’s influential slip-on. 
Ventilations holes are more focused on the midfoot and toe for the Lightblaze Moc, save for a cut-out at the heel that’ll do double duty as a heel pull. But what really makes it stand out most is its implementation of Adidas’ Lightstrike foam, which is more typically reserved for the brand’s performance footwear.
