Booty calls! Kim Kardashian has been hitting up her ex-boyfriends late at night after getting dumped by Odell Beckham Jr. A source exclusively tells Life & Style that the reality star, 43, has made quite a few drunk dials to Pete Davidson, Drake and even Kanye West.
“While Kim always regrets it the next morning, in the moment, no one can stop her,” reveals the source. “Half the time, they don’t even answer. Kim’s friends are begging her to delete these guys’ numbers so she stops embarrassing herself, but she refuses.”
