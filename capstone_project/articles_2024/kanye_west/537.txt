	Fresh off an exciting NBA season that saw him lead the Boston Celtics to their 18th championship, Jaylen Brown is embracing new creative heights. The Finals MVP has been making waves both on and off the court, proving he’s more than just a basketball star. Known for his powerhouse presence on the hardwood, Brown recently showcased his versatility by dropping his debut single, “Just Do It,” featuring A$AP Ferg this past August. The track, he says, was born out of post-championship celebrations. “We were just vibing after the parade, freestyling, and decided to hit the studio,” Brown shared with Billboard. “It was celebration mode, and the song came naturally.”

	Though music might seem like a detour, Brown sees it as another way to express himself. “Basketball is poetry in motion, and music is just another form of that,” he continued, while drawing parallels between his passions. His laid-back yet poetic sound reflects a deep love for creativity that extends to his other ventures, including 741, his self-funded sneaker brand that began after Brown turned down over $50 million in endorsements from major sneaker companies.

	Brown also revealed to Billboard that this venture marks a deeper exploration into his creative side. Despite the complexities of the music industry, he’s open to future collaborations, naming artists like Burna Boy and Kanye West as inspirations. 

	But perhaps his most impactful work lies in his 7uice Foundation, where he addresses educational inequities in underrepresented communities. By introducing kids to STEM and STEAM opportunities, Brown aims to create lasting change. In a time when many athletes are diversifying their brands, Brown’s journey stands out for its depth and purpose. Whether through music, design, or philanthropy, he’s crafting a legacy that goes far beyond the hardwood.

	In this exclusive interview with Billboard, Brown reflects on his journey, balancing basketball with his creative pursuits, and the driving mission behind his work: using his platform to inspire change while staying true to himself.

Your new song, “Just Do It,” with A$AP Ferg is a vibe. How did you guys link up for the track? 

	We were at dinner, just vibing after the parade. Ferg came down, and there was a Chris Brown concert that week. After dinner, we went straight to the studio and started freestyling. It just happened naturally.

	










Is this your entry into music and do you see yourself doing more?Part of me wants to say one and done. I’ve got tremendous respect for people in music, but learning about streaming, licensing, and samples—it’s a lot. The industry gave me a headache, but music allows me to express myself differently than basketball.

Why did you title it “Just Do It?”

	It just fit. We’d just won a championship — that’s what we did. It’s my way of telling the haters I’m having a great time.

If you had to describe your sound in a few words, how would you define it?

	Laid-back, chill, a little poetic. I grew up writing poetry, and that influences my sound. My voice has a deep tone, but it’s calm and reflective.

Who were some of your musical influences growing up?

	Kanye, Lil Wayne, 50 Cent, Kendrick, and Future are my top five. From an OG perspective, Tupac, Biggie, and OutKast were big for me too.

Did you ever see yourself making music as a career, or was your heart always set on basketball?

	Never thought I’d make music, but I love it. It’s a good hobby — keeps you out of trouble. Winning the championship made me say, “Why not?”

Would you be open to more collaborations if the right opportunities came up? If you had more free time, I think people would love to hear more music from you.

	Yeah, I’d love to work with people who inspire me — like Burna Boy, Chris Brown, Kanye. We’ll see. If we win another championship, I’ll definitely drop something.

Your 7uice Foundation is making a real impact. What’s its mission, and what kind of work are you most proud of?











	We’re focused on education inequalities. I grew up in a household where education was non-negotiable—my mom and her family were all teachers. We expose kids from underrepresented communities to STEM and STEAM, helping them explore new opportunities.

You launched 741 as a self-funded, self-designed brand. Why bet on yourself instead of taking those $50 million endorsement deals?

	I’ve been on a creative journey, from designing with Yeezy to starting my own brand. I wanted full control and to create solutions for athletes who face challenges in this space. It’s more than sneakers; it’s a platform for innovation.

What’s been the biggest challenge so far of designing your own brand?

	Delays. From switching factories to fixing minor details, it’s been a learning curve. But every day, my team focuses on incremental growth.

You’ve also invested in Hapbee, a wellness tech company. What drew you to that space?

	Wellness is essential as an athlete. Hapbee uses frequency technology to improve focus, sleep, and recovery without putting anything in your body. It’s cutting-edge, and it works. I use it all the time—it’s been a game changer for me.

With everything — basketball, music, 741, and tech — how do you balance it all?

	Discipline. I stay focused, avoid distractions, and prioritize what matters. Getting good sleep, limiting accessibility, and remembering the legacy I want to leave keeps me grounded.
