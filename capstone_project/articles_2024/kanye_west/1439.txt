Shots fired! Taylor Swift’s songs about Kim Kardashian from The Tortured Poets Department and more albums don’t hold back on how she really feels about Kanye West’s ex-wife following their 2016 feud. 
Swift and Kardashian’s feud started in 2016 when Kardashian’s husband at the time released his single, “Famous,” in which he rapped: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.” Swift and West first made headlines in 2009 when Swift won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video for “You Belong With Me” and West interrupted her acceptance speech to declare that Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” should have won. The two seemed to have made up when Swift presented West with the Video Vanguard Award at the VMAs in 2015. 
That all seemed to change in 2016 when West released “Famous,” which Swift seemed to criticize in her Grammy Award speech for Album of the Year in February 2016. want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame,” she said, referencing West’s lyric “I made that bitch famous” from “Famous.” 
Kardashian claimed in an interview with GQ in June 2016 that Swift knew about “Famous” and approved of the song. A spokesperson for Swift, however, called much of Kardashian’s account “incorrect.” A month later, Kardashian released a Snapchat video of West and Swift’s phone call in which West read part of his lyrics to Swift, who called verse “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex” a “compliment.”
The feud continued with Swift releasing a statement in which she stated that West never played the song in full for her and explained that she took a larger issue with the lyric in which he claimed to have made her “famous.” “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post. 
Swift referenced the feud in her sixth studio album, Reputation, which was her first album released since the drama. She also nodded to the drama between her and Kardashian in her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, which was released in 2024 and seemingly compared Kardashian to a bully.

When I picture my hometownThere’s a bronze spray-tanned statue of youAnd a plaque underneath itThat threatens to push me down the stairs, at our school
But I can’t forget the way you made me healAnd it wasn’t a fair fight, or a clean killEach time that Aimee stomped across my graveAnd then she wrote headlinesIn the local paper, laughing at each baby step I’d take
And maybe you’ve reframed itAnd in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blueI don’t think you’ve changed muchAnd so I changed your name, and any real defining cluesAnd one day, your kid comes home singin’A song that only us two is gonna know is about you
