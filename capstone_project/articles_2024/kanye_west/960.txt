Doja Cat, known for her fearless attitude, unsurprisingly didn’t hold back when addressing trolls who compared her hair to “pubes” after she shared the artwork for her single “Masc.”
Shortly after releasing the track, accompanied by cover art featuring a close-up of her platinum blonde hair, the “Paint the Town Red” recording artist took to Instagram Live to clap back at critics over their immature comments.

“I’m seeing a consistent pattern in my comment section of people asking, ‘Is my hair pubic hair,” she said. “And it’s not even questions. Some people are like, ‘That is what it is.’ We gotta move forward. Let’s stop… I need you guys to get on that…not comparing 4C hair textures to pubes.”

On Friday (March 29), the “Agora Hills” artist resurfaced on Instagram to announce the upcoming release of her new track. In the caption, she teased fans with the date “4.5.24,” insinuating that the full version of the song will drop in just one week.
However, it wasn’t the anticipation of new music that had fans buzzing, but rather the cover art for the song that captured their attention.

Doja’s latest back-and-forth with fans follows her recent announcement she’d be stepping away from socials altogether, citing mental health woes brought on by constant criticism on the popular platform.
“hey i’m gonna deactivate because i’m not really feeling this anymore,” she wrote, taking to Instagram in early March. “you guys take care of yourselves. i like coming here to find inspo and see people being creative but i just feel like this is getting to be too much. the way i’m spoken to on here and treated makes me have fucked up thoughts. Please watch how you talk to and about people on the internet. Bye.”
