Kanye West claimed he's been "helpful" for Taylor Swift's career in a new social media rant.
"I'M SURE I'VE BEEN FAR MORE HELPFUL TO TAYLOR SWIFT'S CAREER THAN HARMFUL" the rapper wrote on Instagram. "TO ALL TAYLOR SWIFT FANS I AM NOT YOUR ENEMY UUUM IM NOT YOUR FRIEND EITHER THOUGH LOL."
On Tuesday, the Chicago native also shared a screenshot on his Instagram Story claiming to have "overtaken Taylor Swift as the top artist globally on Spotify."
In the screenshot, a chart revealed Ye at the top of Spotify's global top artist list on Feb. 11, with Swift, 34, trailing in second place.

A day later, West posted another screenshot on Instagram featuring a Swift fan's post urging fellow listeners to stream Beyoncé's latest track, "TEXAS HOLD 'EM," aiming to secure the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 100 chart, seemingly in an attempt to overshadow Ye's tracks from his new album, "Vultures 1."
Ye took a swipe at Swifties — Taylor Swift's fandom — in the caption of an Instagram post.

"WHEN I SAID THAT I'M THE NEW JESUS B*TCH I WASN'T EVEN THINKING ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT WAS A WHOLE LINE BEFORE BUT I APPRECIATE THE FREE PROMO," West, 46, wrote, referring to a lyric in his new song, "Carnival."
"I'VE BEEN BANNED FROM HOTELS, KICKED OUT OF COMPANIES, AND EVEN NOT ALLOWED TO EAT IN SOME RESTAURANTS," he continued in the post's caption. "EVERYONE SAW VULTURES 1 GET TAKEN OFF OF PLATFORMS TO LIMIT OUR FIRST WEEK NUMBERS."
The caption continued: "THIS REMINDS ME OF THE MISTREATMENT OF MY PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN.REMEMBER I WAS ON TAYLOR'S SIDE WHEN SCOOTER BOUGHT HER MASTERS BEHIND HER BACK."
He emphasized that his new album is centered on positivity and fun, marking a shift after a challenging year that included his divorce from Kim Kardashian and several companies severing business ties with him.
