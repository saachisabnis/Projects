The sidewalks of Los Angeles were recently set ablaze as Bianca Censori, the wife of rapper Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), stepped out in yet another look that had heads turning.
This time, Bianca’s outfit screamed “Kim Kardashian,” as it was uncannily similar to a silver bikini that Ye’s ex-wife was pictured wearing in the past. 43-year-old Kim’s clothing brand SKIMS also previously released a metallic swimwear line in the summer of 2022, which appeared to be the inspiration behind Bianca’s latest outfit.
Clad in a metallic silver micro miniskirt that exposed her butt and a thong that covered the bare essentials, Bianca showcased her take on the metallic trend as she stepped out with the rapper mogul on Tuesday. The ensemble was topped off with a busty triangle bikini top, a piece that would seem right at home in Kim’s wardrobe.
As Bianca led the way out of an LA office building on Tuesday, Ye was pictured behind her, wearing a baggy all-black outfit.

Bianca’s latest explicit outfit comes as fans continue to question whether Ye is controlling his 29-year-old wife.
“I think he really controls her so much and she looks so uncomfortable in it. Just trying to please him and he is not all that. I don’t care how much money he has. He needs help he is not right in the head. They must have some deal going on so he [when he’s] done with her she will get the amount of money she asked for. Crazy World,” read one comment on Facebook.
“I think they both have serious mental problems and they both need help. I feel bad for them they have such sad lives to want to keep doing this,” read another comment.
It was only a day earlier that Ye was captured pulling down Bianca’s tights after he attended a meeting in Beverly Hills.
Bianca was wearing see-through, neon green tights and a tiny beige tube top when Ye reportedly pulled down her tights during their Monday outing. She was later pictured strolling with Ye through The Grove in Los Angeles and then heading to The Cheesecake Factory for a meal.

The string of explicit ensembles from Bianca has reportedly raised concerns among the model’s family members, who also believe Ye is the mastermind behind his wife’s scantily clad looks.
A source close to Bianca told the Daily Mail that her father, Elia “Leo” Censori, wants to have a conversation with Ye about him dressing his daughter as a “trashy naked trophy pony” and parading her around.
“Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” the insider told the outlet.
Leo carries a notorious reputation as a gangster in Australia, having been jailed and convicted in 1982 for possession of a prohibited import, alongside convictions for possessing a pistol and fully jacketed ammunition.
“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands,” the source added. “He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.”
Since Ye and Bianca tied the knot in December 2022, the rapper has also been accused by the family of “shutting her out” from her loved ones in Australia.
“If this isn’t bad enough, the man who is supposed to protect Mr. and Mrs. Censori’s daughter is the same man [who] is shutting her out from her own family,” the insider went on to say. “Leo honestly wants to just sit Kanye down to let him know that he is hurting her family by turning his beloved daughter into a trashy-looking marketable commodity.”
The insider believes a woman walking around in public in such outfits is “control.”
“No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this. That isn’t love. That is control,” they added.

Ye and Bianca’s public appearances, which some believe are testing the limits of public decency, came under fire in France during the Paris Fashion Week. The model showed up in a sheer outfit with a huge fur bomber jacket on but no underwear, leaving her privates exposed. Her outfit faced the possibility of legal action and even a potential prison sentence in France.
During another international trip to Italy, Bianca once again sparked headlines for walking down the streets of Florence in a nude-colored body suit, clutching a purple pillow to her chest.
Sources have claimed that Bianca’s parents are “distressed” over seeing their daughter making headlines across the world for what she is wearing (or not wearing).
“Her family and friends are mortified because it just keeps getting worse and worse,” an insider told the Daily Mail. “Bianca clearly doesn’t realize that what she wore isn’t only disgusting and setting a bad example, but she is also potentially breaking the law.”
“Meanwhile, Kanye is covered up in five layers of clothes and when his wife looked chilly while naked and wrapped in plastic he didn’t so much as offer her one of his capes,” the source added.
“Her parents are so distressed over this because they do not recognize her. She would not be doing this unless she was being controlled,” the source went on to say. “He continues to lock her in by giving her more stake and ownership over various projects that he has going on, including the clothing.”

 As a visual editor in the News team, I look for the most interesting pictures and comments to make each post interesting and informative through images, so that you aren't reading only blocks of text. I joined Bored Panda not that long ago, but in this short amount of time I have covered a wide range of topics: from true crime to Taylor Swift memes (my search history is very questionable because of that).In my freetime, I enjoy spending time at the gym, gaming, binging Great British Bake Off and adding yet another tattoo artist that I would love to get a tattoo from to my pinterest board.
