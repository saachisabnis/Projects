FARGO — “Saturday Night Live” alumnus Pete Davidson will bring his Prehab Tour to the Fargo Theatre for shows at 6:15 and 10 p.m., on Friday, July 5, for shows.
The comedian started on the show when he was just 20 and was one of the youngest cast members ever during his run from 2014 until 2022. He created the character of Chad, an apathetic young man and often was a guest on the show’s Weekend Update.

He starred in Judd Apatow’s 2020 “The King of Staten Island” and created the series “Bupkis” in 2023. He returned to host “Saturday Night Live” in 2023.
Davidson declined to do a second season of “Bupkis,” which is largely based on his personal life.
“I’ve always seen Bupkis as a window into my life, since it is so personal and about my struggles and family. After nearly a decade of my personal life being in the media I wanted a chance to tell my story my way,” Davidson told The Hollywood Reporter in March. “Of all the work I’ve ever done, Bupkis is by far what I’m most proud of.”
Davidson has been open about his mental health issues and his use of marijuana. He is almost as well known for his romantic life as he is for his comedy. He was engaged to Arianna Grande and has dated a number of models and actresses, including Kate Beckinsale, Margaret Qualley and Kim Kardashian, whose ex-husband, Kanye West, recorded tracks threatening the comedian.
Tickets for this mature audience show are $78 and $128, plus fees and go on sale at 10 a.m., Friday, April 19 at
