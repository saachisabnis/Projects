The Game discussed his interesting dating history, including a brief romantic relationship with Kim Kardashian. He warmly described Kim as one of the "coolest and sweetest people around" and mentioned her surprising cooking skills. The rapper met Kim Kardashian at the house of Kim's previous boyfriend, Ray J. Despite a mutual attraction, the Game insists their relationship didn't immediately escalate. Their affair lasted about eight months, during a period when both were occupied with burgeoning careersâ€”Kim with her reality show filming and him at the start of his music career. The Game expressed his concurrent respect for her ex-husband, Kanye West, and asserted that there is nothing but love and respect between all parties involved. The relationship took place prior to Kim's notorious tape with Ray J.
