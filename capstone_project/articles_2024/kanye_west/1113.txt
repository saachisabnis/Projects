Kid Cudi has cleared up suggestions he was taking a shot at Drake while setting the record straight on his songwriting credits.
The Cleveland rapper was replying to a fan on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday (May 7) who speculated that Lil Yachty, who co-produced his INSANO (NITRO MEGA) track “Superboy,” did more than just make the beat.

“No one writes my lyrics EVER,” he replied. “Every song U have ever heard from me, I wrote. The credits on songs can be confusing when u see all those names, and its usually producers of the song or sample.”
Cudi then emphasized his point by writing in a separate post: “Its a really powerful feeling knowing I wrote the lyrics on all 12 of my albums.”

When some interpreted his comments as a dig at Drake, who has been plagued by ghostwriting allegations over the last decade, Mr. Rager denied throwing shade at his “IMY2” collaborator.
“Man me speakin my truth is not me dissing anyone. Its my truth. Its a fact,” he clarified. “This came up cuz someone was talkin like yachty wrote my verse on superboy. Just wanted to address it and make it 100% clear.”

Lil Yachty has been accused of working for Drake as a ghostwriter, most prominently by friend turned foe Rick Ross.
After a purported demo of Drizzy’s Her Loss hit “Jumbotron Shit Poppin” recorded by Yachty leaked online, Rozay was quick to fuel the speculation.

He added: “YACHT AKA THE PEN [five writing emojis].”

This is not the first time that Kid Cudi has been forced to clear the air regarding his relationship Drake.
While discussing his turbulent relationship with Kanye West in a 2022 interview with Esquire, he said: “With all due respect, I’m not Drake, who’s about to take a picture with him next week and be friends again, and their beef is squashed. That’s not me.

“What I say, I mean. I will be done with you. It’s gonna take a motherfucking miracle for me and that man to be friends again. I don’t see it happening. He gon’ have to become a monk.”
Cudi later clarified his comments, tweeting: “Just to be clear, I wasnt tryna throw a shot at Drake. I got love 4 him. My point I was tryna make is that im not so forgiving. Meaning he might be a lil nicer than me in that situation w dude. Thats all. Maybe that came off wrong thru my words. So yea, all good w Drake.”
