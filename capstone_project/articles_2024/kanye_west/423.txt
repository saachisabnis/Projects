Bianca Censori made yet another bold fashion statement during a dinner date in Los Angeles with her husband, Kanye West, on April 7.
The couple was seen holding hands as Censori turned heads in a daring, completely sheer nude strapless dress that showcased her figure without any underwear beneath. She paired the risqué fashion choice with knee-high red stockings and bright pink mule heels.
The former Yeezy architect chose a slicked-back hairstyle, complementing her husband's typical all-black attire, which included a windbreaker jacket, pants, boots, gloves, and sunglasses for their nighttime venture.
This outfit follows closely on the heels of a similar one by Censori on April 5, where she was spotted in a black lacy bra and high-waisted, nude tights, strategically using a small clutch to cover herself as they entered a restaurant.
The couple was also spotted on Easter in Malibu, with Censori wearing yet another unique ensemble while out to dinner at infamous celeb hotspot, Nobu. The 29-year-old turned heads in a skintight silver bodysuit, embodying a futuristic vibe paired with white strappy kitten heels and her hair styled in a sleek bun. The pair's Easter activities included treating Ye's children — North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4, whom he shares with ex-wife Kim Kardashian, to dinner and a family movie night, according to the Daily Mail.
While some have criticized the stark contrast between the Australian model's revealing outfit choices and the rapper's more conservative, all black style, suggesting it might be humiliating for her, the couple has yet to address these comments publicly.
"I feel so sorry for her, she's on display" remarked one user on an Instagram post of the couple. "She's a grown woman and knows what she's doing. He's not forcing her to do anything. She's comfortable dressing the way she does so let her be." remarked another.
In response to rumors suggesting disapproval from her family about both her attire and husband, Censori's sister Angelina recently came forward to dismiss such claims, emphasizing the family's support for the couple amidst public scrutiny. "It's all just bulls**t. There was something about my dad even recently. My dad never talks. Nothing's true," she shared with the Herald Sun.
