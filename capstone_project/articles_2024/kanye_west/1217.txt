Scooter Braun wants to put an end to his longtime riff with Taylor Swift.
The record executive and “Fortnight” singer are the subjects of the Max docuseries “Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood,” which chronicles the fallout that occurred after he acquired the rights to her first six albums in 2019.
During Thursday’s Bloomberg Screentime event in Los Angeles, Braun reportedly told attendees he finally got around to watching the documentary after initially dismissing it for what he thought would be a negative depiction.
“I watched it recently,” he said of the documentary released in June. “I wasn’t going to watch it because I just thought it was going to be, like, another hit piece. … [But] my dad called me and my mom, and they were like, we just watched it. We think you should watch it. So I did.”
The two-part series shares both sides of the story that ignited a feud and continues to prompt backlash from Swift fans.
“Look, it’s five years later,” Braun said at the event, according to Bloomberg. “I think, everyone, it’s time to move on. There were a lot of things that were misrepresented.”
The music mogul, who has managed Justin Bieber, Kanye West and the Black Eyed Peas, among others, went on to stress the importance of “communicat[ing] directly with each other” when dealing with conflict.
“I think doing it out on social media and in front of the whole world is not the place,” said the 43-year-old New York City native. “I think when people actually take the time to stand in front of each other have a conversation, they usually find out the monster’s not real. And that has not happened.”
