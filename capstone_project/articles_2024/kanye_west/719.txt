PINE RIVER
    
       â€” Pine River-Backus High School students got practice in exercising their American right to vote during an Oct. 30 mock election at the school.
This was the first mock election held at the school in recent years, and it was performed just like a real election, including registration, voting in private, election judges and more.

Students used drafts of the ballots that Pine River residents received during the official general election Nov. 5.
"It's got the city council, the local soil and water, school board, as well as the national elections and judicial elections," said teacher Isaac Anderson. "On Monday (Oct. 28), our civics classes also had some training through a couple of local election judges, Liz Dahl and Stephanie Burns."
The mock election was run through a statewide YMCA program, organized locally by Pine River-Backus teacher Lisa Toft. 
The Minnesota Secretary of State Office and YMCA sponsor this civic engagement for students, and hundreds of Minnesota schools participate, Toft said. 
"We're one of the first elections in the schools that are participating and then we're going to be tallied together as a youth vote for Minnesota, so we want our students to be part of that and begin to realize they have a voice," she said.
The PR-B School mock election may have had a significantly greater election turnout than a lot of local precincts.
"Stephanie said they have around 74 registered voters in their precinct," Anderson said. "Liz Dahl was talking about around 300 in total, so we'll probably have a lot more in just our election."

"I think we'll be over 600 if everyone is here," Toft said. "That includes staff and students."
Students said the experience was a great introduction to the real thing.
"It gives you a pretty good idea of what to do," said student Kolby Walters. "It's cool seeing what the ballots will actually look like."
It was also an opportunity for them to get just a taste of the rights they inherit upon becoming adults.
"I do feel this is important for people to have a say without necessarily participating in the election," said student Keylah Kendrick. "I think elections are a good way to represent what you believe, and with the campaigning and everything it's a good way to see what your party is doing that could make things better."
