Kendrick Lamar set the Hip Hop world alight with his Drake diss song “Euphoria,” but Cam’ron and Ma$e weren’t blown away by what they heard.
The Harlem rappers turned sports personalities shared their thoughts on the explosive track on the their show It Is What It Is on Wednesday (May 1), with both men agreeing that the 6 God is winning the battle so far.

“Drake is definitely winning from an MC standpoint,” Ma$e said, praising the Toronto native’s own recent diss songs “Push Ups” and “Taylor Made Freestyle.”
“It took a while for us to get the record from Kendrick and when you wait a while it gotta be outta this world. I think if Kendrick dropped this record right after ‘[Push Ups] Drop and Give Me 50,’ it would have been crazy.”

Killa Cam added: “I think Drake is winning. ‘Euphoria’ didn’t really move me. I’m expecting lyrics from Kendrick, you’re expecting certain things. The song was kinda long, it took too long to come out — pause. I’m not saying it’s bad.”
Murda interjected: “It was a good record [but] we didn’t wait a while for a good record […] It’s like when you did ‘Curtis’ [Cam’ron’s 50 Cent diss song], it’s a certain thing you gotta have in the record that Kendrick doesn’t have in his record.

“You gotta say something that make n-ggas look at the n-gga different. And when he did the, ‘I don’t want to hear you say n-gga,’ that was an angle that we already heard before.”
Cam then analyzed the entire beef between Kendrick and Drake (and others in Hip Hop), claiming the stakes aren’t as high as when he was feuding with some of his rap peers in the ’90s and ’00s.

“I’m not saying this rap beef isn’t interesting and entertaining, but when we was rap disses — and not just me, I’m saying in general — people had the potential to die or get seriously hurt,” he said. “I just don’t feel that in these battles.
“I’m not promoting [violence]; I’m happy that nobody will get hurt, hopefully. But it just felt dangerous. This doesn’t feel like a dangerous atmosphere to me.”

Drake himself has also reacted to “Euphoria,” choosing to troll Kendrick Lamar over some of his lyrics on the song.
The Toronto native uploaded a clip to Instagram from the 1999 comedy 10 Things I Hate About You where Julia Stiles’ character recites a poem listing off all of the things she hates about a crush even though she loves them.

The clip is a clear reference to the part on “Euphoria” where Kendrick raps: “I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress/ I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it’s gon’ be direct/ We hate the bitches you fuck, ’cause they confuse themself with real women.”
Drake, through Akademiks, also teased a response to the track.

Speaking on his Rumble channel, Ak read out a text from the rap star that said: “I’m energized by the elimination of Drake… See you soon,” with the first part being a reference to recent comments made by Kanye West.
The media personality also claimed that Drake told him: “If you think this is fire, you have no idea what I got coming.”
