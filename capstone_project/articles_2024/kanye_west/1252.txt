She’s a biker babe. 
Kim Kardashian, 44, took her skin-tight hosiery for a spin — quite literally.
On Wednesday, the fashion mogul shared images of herself riding a e-bike late at night, clad in a white Skims long-sleeve shirt and matching thong atop sheer tights and complementing heels.
Kardashian played up the edgy biker vibes by way of a helmet, camo balaclava and gloves. 
“enjoy the ride,” the mother of four captioned the post. 
Fans quickly took to the comment section, sharing funny thoughts on her nighttime excursion.
“Kim, that’s not what people wear when they ride,” one person noted.
A second wrote, “I love Kim but you can’t tell me she knows how to ride that thing 😂”
Meanwhile, others of course drew connections in her outfit to Kanye West’s new wife Bianca Censori, who loves to pair body-baring one-pieces with tights and heels.
“Dressed like her ex’s new wife lol,” said one user, while another commented “Bianka, what are you doing there? Dressed?!”
This sultry photoshoot comes just a day after Kardashian posted snaps wearing a balaclava and fuzzy two-piece set — again bringing the Australian star to mind.
“Imitating the ex’s current girlfriend to try and get the ex back? Hmmm???” one person commented on Kardashian’s captionless post from yesterday.
Another said, “Kimye back ?! 😳”
This isn’t the first time Kardashian has been accused of stealing Censori’s go-to look.
In August, the reality television star hit the streets in a white bodysuit and tights mash-up, which resembled a lace hosiery look Censori sported in March. 
A few months ago, there were rumors about a potential split between West and Censori; however, the couple set the record straight during a recent trip to Tokyo, where they were out and about together.
The duo tied the knot in Dec. 2022, just one month after Kardashian and West’s divorce was finalized.
