	Prior to December 2014, J. Cole had already attained commercial success and notoriety as a formidable lyricist but had yet to truly cement himself as a dominant force in Hip-Hop.

	The North Carolina native first made waves in 2009, after news of JAY-Z making him the flagship rap artist of Roc Nation surfaced ahead of the release of his mixtape, The Warm Up. That cosign, however invaluable, immediately created high expectations for Cole. He was viewed as the predecessor and progeny of arguably the greatest rapper of all time.

	Cole’s potential was evident upon the release of the mixtape, which was built upon Friday Night Lights, the instantly classic mixtape that created overwhelming anticipation for his solo debut album. Iin 2011, Cole World: The Sideline Story debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart and earned Platinum certification from the RIAA.

	However, it was widely deemed underwhelming in comparison to his previous efforts, raising some uncertainty about his ability to live up to the promise of being one of the leaders of the new generation.

	Two years later, Cole doubled back with his sophomore album, Born Sinner, which duplicated Cole World‘s chart dominance and received stronger reviews. However, it was viewed as falling short of recent releases from his rap peers, bordering him between the distinction of being a top prospect and a true contender for the crown.

	Having admitted his past creative mishaps on Born Sinner, Cole decided to lock in and return to his roots. He recorded his third studio album in his home state and returned to his childhood home, which inspired the album’s title. 

	Released on Dec. 9, the following year, 2014 Forest Hills Drive saw Cole divert from his previous formula, shunning blatant attempts at radio airplay in favor of songs that resonated with his core base, a focus he failed to hold throughout his first two albums.

	The result was rave reviews from critics and listeners alike without diminishing his returns. The album became his third to top the Billboard 200 and would go on to become his best-selling album to date. 

	In celebration of its release anniversary, VIBE took a trip down memory lane, parked in front of 2014 Forest Hills Drive, and ranked the album from top to bottom.

	Which song is the overall best on the album? Find out below.

	On this heartfelt outro cut, Jermaine Cole speaks to the man in the mirror, shedding layers of self-doubt while proclaiming that outside forces simply don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. 

	Part reflective, part self-congratulatory, the track is fairly reminiscent of Kanye West’s classic The College Dropout sendoff but it falls short of its predecessor due to a plodding backdrop soundtracking Cole’s disjointed rambles.

	Reflections on love lost are at the forefront of this piano and string-laden selection, as Cole calls out for clarity and closure on the possibilities of what could’ve been. 

	The downsides are the distractingly incessant 808s and his double-time delivery, leaving a bit to be desired, thus placing this among the more pedestrian inclusions on what’s otherwise a sterling tracklist.

	Hesitance of embracing the trappings and ills of fame and fortune are conveyed on this breezy salvo, which is powered by a sample of Mobb Deep’s classic The Infamous single, “Give Up The Good’s (Just Step).” 

	Bolstered by backing vocals by Dreamville affiliate Rose “TS” Desandies, the cut’s searing violins and horns, and Cole’s refrain, “It’s been hard for me to smile,” gives this tune a soul-stirring sense of solemnness.

	Memories of teenage ambitions and angst are conjured. J. Cole looks back on the internal turmoil he experienced while navigating his Carolina stomping grounds. 

	Admissions of a lack of gratitude for his mother’s upward mobility amid a thirst for street credibility are conveyed in a conversational context, as he leans in on using those grains of wisdom to fuel his hunger.

	The introductory selection is key in setting a tone that could potentially make or break an album and is an art in itself. 

	However, J. Cole passes that test with flying colors on this particular occasion, proving that the third time is usually the charm in accomplishment or attainment. 

	The sheer emotion that sweeps through as J. Cole simply inquires about one’s desire to be happy and free of hate, stress, doubt, and fear is one that’s palpable and can be felt from its opening notes.

	Fiery flows and rollicking instrumentals are winning ingredients in the deliverance of food for thought, both of which are present on this scorching tour de force as the Red Storm alum rains down bars while lyrically imposing his will. 

	One of the more freewheeling selections on the album, this track simply provides its host with ample opportunity to showcase that he’s one of the illest spitters on the hemispheres.

	Upon hearing this ode to Cole’s own birthdate for the first time, the reaction from many was that a certain je ne sais quoi was in the sonics, signaling a potentially transcendent and defining body of work. 

	Those premonitions, based on Cole’s masterful performance, ultimately proved to be accurate, making this track a pivotal deep cut in his discography.

	Hollywood Cole makes his return as Jermaine goes on a victory lap back to his Fayetteville stomping grounds and silences any speculation of him not being good in his own hood. 

	With the loose theme of warding admirers from jacking his style and haters from his circumference, Jermaine simply styles on the competition while deeming himself a lyricist supreme amid all challengers.

	The disparity between his formative habitat and his lifestyle as a rap star is examined, with Cole balancing the positive and negative aspects of each realm on his proverbial scale. 

	Admissions that his rose-tinted view of the highlife may have been delusions of grandeur, he wrestles between those two realities, ultimately choosing to embark outside of his comfort zone.

	Some things in life get finer with time, especially when they’re allowed to properly age and afford the world space to get in tune. 

	This is applicable to this standout, which was initially panned by a number of critics but has grown to become one of the greatest conceptual cuts regarding puberty, sexual exploration, and the rites of passage for listeners of all genders.

	A reflection on overcoming adversity, “Apparently” is Cole’s self-assured declaration of perseverance in the face of life’s harsh realities. 

	The track reveals his journey through struggles, letting listeners know that despite the challenges, he’s emerged stronger, grounded in his belief that everything happens for a reason. 

	The calming yet triumphant production sets the tone for Cole’s contemplative flow, while his lyrics push the message that growth often comes through pain.

	Cole takes a candid approach on “No Role Modelz” and cautions men about the dangers of idolizing women who live by their own rules, especially those with liberated sexual freedoms. 

	With sharp wit and unapologetic honesty, he weaves a narrative about the pitfalls of seeking relationships that blur the lines between respect and indulgence. 

	Through the lens of his personal experiences, he shows the wisdom that comes with navigating complicated relationships and the importance of self-awareness.

	On “Love Yourz,” J. Cole delivers a poignant anthem about finding contentment in one’s own life and rejecting societal pressures to keep up with external appearances. 

	In contrast to hyper-materialism, Cole reminds us that true happiness comes from within, urging listeners to appreciate what they have instead of envying others. 

	With a message grounded in gratitude, “Love Yourz” is a testament to Cole’s maturity as an artist and the most enduring song on his most acclaimed album to date.
