EXCLUSIVE: Brandon Marshall says Taylor Swift allegedly got Kanye West kicked out of the Super Bowl after learning he bought tickets in front of her suite ðŸ‘€ pic.twitter.com/sqLsTTqsAg
Taylor Swift allegedly had Kanye West removed from his seats at Allegiant Stadium after the rapper tried to upstage her at the Super Bowl on Sunday, according to former NFL star Brandon Marshall. ...
But his alleged plans were foiled, according to Marshall, who went on to claim that the Anti-Hero hitmaker 'made a call' to have him removed from the stadium entirely.Â 
Marshall suggested that Kanye was strategically placing himself in front of Taylor's suite to photobomb all her appearances on the broadcast, when the cameras would inevitably cut to the girlfriend of Kelce.Â 
I'm not sure that I buy this. If West had already bought the tickets, how would he get kicked out of the stadium? And would those seats have been available in the first place?
Ehhhh ... never mind. It's too fun to check. Revenge is a dish best served on prime-time TV, after all.Â
