Dave Chappelle reportedly made some wise cracks about his longtime friend Kanye West and wife Bianca Censori during a recent standup performance.
On Sunday (April 7), a user wrote on the the Chicago native’s Reddit forum shared a thread about seeing the Half Baked actor perform the night prior at his newly opened comedy club in Ohio. Despite previously condemning Ye for his antisemitic remarks, the funnyman apparently clarified that he has no issues with the Yeezy boss and that he’d even gone out to eat with him and his wife.

“I went to a dave chappelle show last night and he had multiple jokes directed at ye throughout the night, but he did say theres no beef between them,” the user wrote. “He recently had dinner with ye and bianca but said it was the most uncomfortable dinner hes ever attended because bianca was basically naked.
“he said it looked like she woke up put some makeup on ,slapped some duct tape on her tittys and shoved a cork up her pussy and walked out the door.”

While hosting Saturday Night Live for the third time back in 2022, Chappelle walked out to the opening notes of Otis Redding’s “Try A Little Tenderness,” which Ye famously sampled on Watch The Throne‘s “Otis.” He then proceeded to read a prepared statement denouncing antisemitism before dedicating half of his 15-minute set to Kanye.
“I probably been doing this 35 years now,” he began joked, setting the tone for what was to follow. “And early in my career, I learned that there are two words in the English language that you never say together in sequence. And those words are ‘the’ and ‘Jews.’ I’ve never seen someone do good after they said that.”

The Washington, DC native went on to say that he only vaguely remembered how Ye’s antisemitic provocations began, before recounting his exact reaction to the tweet that would eventually cost the Donda rapper his Twitter account.
In typical Chappelle fashion, the monologue was a balance of poignant commentary and memorable punchlines, like the when he recalled asking his friends in high school why some Jewish people “dress like Run-DMC” or the moment he quipped, “Ironically, adidas was founded by Nazis, and event they were offended.”

His monologue seemed to denounce Ye’s antisemitic comments while also suggesting that the statements the embattled rapper made about Jewish people in Hollywood might not be baseless either.
“It’s just the rules of perception,” Chappelle said. “If they’re Black, then it’s a gang. If they’re Italian, it’s the mob. But if they’re Jewish, it’s a coincidence and you should never speak about it.”
