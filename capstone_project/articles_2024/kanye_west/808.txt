Kanye West has taken a trip down memory lane ahead of his second Vultures listening experience in China with Ty Dolla $ign.
Taking to Instagram early Friday (September 27), the Chicago native shared an old photo of him in the Asian country as a child, along with the caption: “BACK AGAIN.”

In the picture, a young Yeezy can be seen wearing a pair of crisp white Nike sneakers while stood next to what appears to be an elevator, with a sign above it reading: “Chungking House.”
The rap legend lived in China for a short period as a kid after he and his mother Donda West moved to the city of Nanjing where she worked as a teacher.
Before his and Ty Dolla $ign’s first concert in China earlier this month, Kanye promoted the gig by unearthing another rare photo from his childhood.
That one showed him sitting on the steps of Huang Shan (otherwise known as the Yellow Mountain) and was simply captioned: “BACK.”

The Vultures duo performed at Haikou’s Wuyuanhe Stadium on September 15 in front of a sold-out crowd of over 40,000, making them one of the few Western acts to perform in the notoriously strict country.
The concert produced a number of notable moments, including the premiere of an unlikely remix of Vanessa Carlton’s 2002 pop hit “A Thousand Miles.”

Ye also debuted another unreleased track called “Preacher Man” which he said is from his “next project,” although he didn’t specify whether that’s Vultures 3 or a separate solo album.
The G.O.O.D. Music founder additionally shared the stage with his four children — North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm — while running through over 90 songs from his decorated discography.
