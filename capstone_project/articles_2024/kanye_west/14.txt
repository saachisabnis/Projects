Geminis love to learn new things, and they love to do it all the time. They are excellent conversationalists and seemingly never run out of energy for chatting about any conceivable topic. They tend to be quite extroverted and silly, especially if they think they share company with those who find them amusing. The “twins” of the zodiac also are able to see situations from from a dual perspective. They are social creatures and are likely to have a calendar full of invites, which they will surely enliven.
A Leo is a born leader thanks to their inherent strength and forceful nature. They are fiercely confident and know the point of life is to live it to the fullest. Why bother doing anything halfhearted, or to pretend to be anything other than brave, bold and fabulous? They are eager to take on challenges, in part for the bragging rights. Leos want a mate who shares their passions as they want deep devotion and focused attention. Get out of the way if the Leo in your life has his or her heart set on something.
Gemini and Leo's natural compatibility is apparent to anyone who gets to experience this dynamic and intellectually charged pairing for themselves.
They have a mutual admiration for one another. Gemini is generally easy-going and able to make space for Leo’s blustery confidence. Leo, meanwhile, amplifies Gemini's natural friendliness. They have a lively and engaging back-and-forth. 
When it comes to challenges, Leo may think Gemini, in all their flightiness, isn't devoted to the relationship; Gemini may think Leo comes on too strong.
Friendship between Gemini and Leo is fun and exciting. Both signs are social, creative and vibrant. Gemini amplifies Leo's confidence, and Leo sees Gemini's socializing skills as borderline genius. Challenges can arise when Leo seeks too much attention from Gemini who needs alone time to recharge between socializing. A simple conversation about boundaries will fix this up fast. These two appreciate one another’s best qualities. This is a joyful connection filled with laughter and mutual support.
Chances are, Gemini and Leo will be enthusiastic about one another and connect on physical and emotional levels. Gemini’s friendliness goes hand-in-hand with Leo’s charisma, making them a likable duo. Gemini may be slow to commit but with time, they will come to understand that Leo is genuine in their devotion. Leo has to be patient with Gemini, even while pursuing them with passion, and understand it will take them a while to settle down. 
When Gemini and Leo get married, they're signing up for a lifetime of adventure. Both signs are relentlessly social and so will understand each other. Their decision-making style is complementary, too. Gemini is inclined to go with the flow and let Leo make the big moves. These two will learn how to compromise Leo’s need for attention with Gemini’s need for freedom. Sometimes, Gemini might not be "up" for Leo — and in those cases, they can take some time apart.
Is it work — or is it a party? When it comes to Gemini and Leo at the workplace, the answer could be both. Both signs love socializing and creating, and so they make the office a lively and engaging place to be. Gemini’s flexibility complements Leo’s leadership skills making them excellent collaborators. They appreciate each other’s strengths.
Gemini and Leo both are blessed with abundant energy — especially for fun and socializing. In each other, Gemini and Leo will find a perfect partner in crime (or excitement).
Essentially, know that Gemini and Leo will help each other relish the day-to-day. Boredom will be a distant idea — not a reality — when these two get together.
Neither sign is known for their attention span. Gemini and Leo will have to keep the relationship interesting in order for them to stay invested. When daily life kicks in, with all of its lulls, Gemini and Leo will have to work to create glimmers within the routine.
Their love for socializing has another edge, too. Leo, preferring to be possessive of their chosen partner, will have to confront the fact that Gemini simply loves to talk — and sometimes flirt — with other people.
