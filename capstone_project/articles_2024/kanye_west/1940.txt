Kim Kardashian initially was “fighting against” the idea of her son having a YouTube channel.
The reality superstar — who has North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm with ex-husband Kanye West —recently saw her second child launch a social media presence and described the whole thing as a “blessing in disguise” because of how it has brought hm closer to his older sister.
“Follow Saint on YouTube because he stalks me every single day! It’s hard because I’m here and I need to approve every video, but I will say that it has brought him and North closer together because she’s filming his content and making him do challenges, so it’s actually a blessing in disguise. I was fighting against it, but it’s working in my favor!” she told “Entertainment Tonight.”
Kardashian revealed earlier this month that she had “finally allowed” her eldest boy to launch an account on the platform, but compiled a strict list of rules for his posts first.
“Saint signed a solid contract for his YouTube Channel. He better not breach,” The ‘Kardashians’ star wrote, sharing the handwritten contract on her Instagram Story
The document — which was signed by Saint — acknowledged the youngster “agreed to follow mom’s rules.”
“I am not allowed to comment any personal family information. I am not allowed to film any personal information. I am not allowed to film while North is recording music,” the agreement stated.
“I must show my mom or guardian all videos before I post them. I give permission to any grown-up if mom says to delete my video for any reason,” the agreement continued. However, Kardashian’s caption obscured a few sentences.
And if Saint breaches the terms, the youngster’s stint on the video platform could terminated.
“If I don’t listen to all of the rules, Mom could make my page private or delete my account,” the contract concluded.
