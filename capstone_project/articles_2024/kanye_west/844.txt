Things are about to get gruesome on next week's episode of The Kardashians! In a sneak peek, Kim Kardashian visits a doctor's office where she shows off her bandage-free finger. 
"Oh, that looks great!" the doctor says as he removes Kim's bandage to reveal her sliced finger. 
"You think that looks great?" the 43-year-old reality star asks, seemingly surprised by the reaction. 
Showing an X-ray of the damaged digit, Kim explains, "The tip broke off. It was more painful than childbirth."
Kim gave birth to her and Kanye West's oldest children, 11-year-old North West and 8-year-old Saint West, and is also mom to 6-year-old Chicago and 5-year-old Psalm via surrogate. 
Though Kim doesn't reveal what happened to cause her finger getting sliced, she did spark concern back in February when she sported large bandages over her middle and ring fingers on her left hand. 
Around that time, Kim spoke with ET at the 2024 Super Bowl, which she attended with the bandages on her fingers. When asked who she was rooting for during the big game, Kim told ET, "Everybody," later clarifying, "Anyone who wants to do a SKIMS campaign." 
Kim, who was rumored to be romancing NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. at the time, posted an Instagram of herself catching a football days before she was seen with the bandages, prompting fans to speculate that the show of athleticism possibly led to the injury. 
By the next month, Kim was not wearing the bandages when she attended the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party, so it looks like her finger healed. 
And while the mother of four's injury seems to be all better, the tension between her and her sister, Khloé Kardashian, has been palpable on this season of The Kardashians. 
New episodes of The Kardashians stream Thursdays on Hulu.
