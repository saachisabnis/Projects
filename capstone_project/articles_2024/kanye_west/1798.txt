Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's new collaborative album, Vultures 1, was distributed to the major streaming services last weekend by a company called FUGA — who now say they declined to work with the duo.
“Late last year, FUGA was presented with the opportunity to release Vultures 1,” a rep told Billboard. “Exercising our judgment in the ordinary course of business, we declined to do so.” However, “on Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement. Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”
But by the end of the day, the album found a new distributor, Label Engine, founded in 2022.
