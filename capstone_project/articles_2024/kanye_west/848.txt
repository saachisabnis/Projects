Drizzy took the stage at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida for the first show of his It’s All a Blur — Big As the What? Tour last month. It wasn’t long before fans noticed that he had on what appeared to be a dinosaur spine outfit.
Soon after the show, Drizzy took to his Instagram Stories and shared an image of Japanese artist Shimoda Masakatsu wearing the item, making it clear who likely created the costume. Masakatsu is famous for his dinosaur head and skeleton pieces, which he has made in collaboration with Comme des Garçons.
