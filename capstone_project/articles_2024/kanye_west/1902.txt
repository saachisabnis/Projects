Julia Fox isn’t looking back fondly on her brief relationship with Kanye West.
When asked in a Cosmopolitan video, shared on Monday, which of her exes is the “most cringe,” Fox tartly replied.
“All of them, guys. They’re all really embarrassing. From my baby daddy…to the other one…,” she said, seemingly acknowledging West.
However, she did add that her most cringe-worthy ex is “my drug-dealer boyfriend that kidnapped me when I was in high school and didn’t let me leave his house. Cringe!”
The model, 34, had a high-profile romance with West in 2023 that lasted less than two months and came on the heels of a bruising breakup with her ex-husband, pilot Peter Artemiev — the father of her 3-year-old son, Valentino.
The controversial rapper was also in the middle of a contentious divorce from Kim Kardashian.
Fox detailed the fling in her 2023 memoir, “Down the Drain,” in which she didn’t use his name but merely referred to him as “the artist.”
She claimed that the “Bound 2” performer offered to get her a boob job, criticized her friends, seemingly set up paparazzi shots, and pressured her to sign an NDA.

Fox described the relationship as a “sick, twisted game” for West, 46.
In an In Style interview published earlier this month, Fox shared that the short tryst left her with “such a sour taste” in her mouth because she felt she’d lost her identity during the process and would no longer consider dating anyone in “this sphere.”
“Because I don’t ever want to just be known as someone’s girlfriend. I know I’m so much more than that,” Fox added.
The actress hasn’t always been so critical of West, telling “Entertainment Tonight” two months after they split, that dating him was the “best thing that could have happened” to her.
“It kind of brought a spark back into my life that I had kind of forgotten about,” she shared.
After the pair split, Fox admitted there “wasn’t any” sex in their romance because it “wasn’t really about that.”
