Kanye West is offering a rare peek into his relationship with Bianca Censori with multiple social media tributes to his wife.
The 46-year-old “Heartless” rapper — whose Instagram grid currently has only nine posts, all of which are of the 29-year-old Yeezy architectural designer and were posted this week — shared six new posts of Censori on Saturday.
“Happy birthday to the most beautiful super bad iconic muse inspirational talented artist masters degree in architecture 140 IQ loving by my side everyday when half the world turned their backs on me and the most amazing stepmom to our children I love you so much thank you for sharing your life with me,” wrote the Grammy winner, whose career went off the rails amid a slew of controversial remarks last year — namely antisemitic screeds, for which he recently apologized in a vague post written in Hebrew.
Captioning another snap of a grinning Censori, West said: “I miss you when I wake up before you.”
West and Censori — who bears a striking resemblance to his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, and who has worked for his Yeezy company since 2020 — had a wedding-like ceremony last January, TMZ reported at the time. He and 43-year-old Kardashian, who share four children, finalized their divorce just two months prior.
Though the largely under-the-radar couple was long reported to have wed without filing an official marriage certificate, a source told Us Weekly in October that the ceremony was the real deal and for “religious reasons.”
“Kanye and Bianca were legally married last year when they had their private ceremony in Beverly Hills, it was real and legal,” said the insider, who revealed they actually tied the knot on Dec. 20, 2022 — just under a month after West finalized his divorce from Kardashian.
The couple reportedly kept their nuptials under wraps by using a “confidential marriage license.”
