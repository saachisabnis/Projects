Cam’ron has spoken about his past beefs with the likes of Nas and 50 Cent and opined why they make more sense than the current glut of rap feuds.
Speaking in a video posted to Instagram over the weekend, the Dipset rapper and It Is What It Is co-host explained his own history when it comes to battling opponents.

“Nas is one of my favorite artists, if not my favorite artist,” he began. “When Nas dissed me, I was like, ‘Damn.’ We grew up on Nas. What did Nas diss us for? So when he dissed me for no reason, I’m like, ‘Damn, I didn’t do nothing to Nas.’ But it was when I just signed to Roc-A-Fella and I was like, ‘Damn, man. Do we ignore Nas or do we respond to Nas?’

“To me, that was against the rule. We had no platinum album out, Dipset was just developing. Then when we dissed Nas, that was our second mixtape. But we had to do that ’cause we just getting in the door after a fucked up deal I had at Sony. That’s why I did it — I felt our backs were against the wall.”
Cam also spoke on his beef with 50 Cent: “When me and 50 Cent was going on, that shit was fun. Shout out to my n-gga 50, we good now too. But when 50 dissed me, it started when 50 said Koch [Entertainment] is the graveyard for a lot of rappers. At the time, Jim Jones had just gone to Koch and Jim Jones is Dipset so we got into a whole argument on the phone.
“All that shit to me was just music. Even when 50 and me spoke, he was like, ‘Let’s get to this money.’ When we spoke, we laughed about that shit. At the time, I went at 50 because he had done a diss track. 50 was putting n-ggas out of business with his diss songs.”

The Harlem native then explained why he doesn’t understand the wars currently being waged in Hip Hop: “What the fuck is this beef going on today? What’s it about? Everyone that’s rapping is rich. There’s beef and there’s rich. And it can’t be about no money. What’s the problem? I don’t get it. Can y’all tell me what this shit is about?”
