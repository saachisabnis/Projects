Common has given props to Kanye West and J Dilla on the anniversary of his “life-changing” album Be.
The Chicago rapper took to Instagram on Sunday (May 26) to reflect on his sixth LP, which arrived to critical acclaim on May 24, 2005.

In his post, Common saluted both Ye and Jay Dee who between them produced almost the entirety of the album. The former also featured on several songs including “They Say,” “Go!” and “The Corner.”
“I was reminded that yesterday was the 19th anniversary for Be. How grateful I am to YE and J Dilla and all the artists and musicians who created on that album,” he wrote.
“Be changed my life and it’s amazing how many people come to me young and old (well older ha) who tell me they were inspired by that album. Give Thanks To The MOST HIGH.”
This isn’t the first time that Common has reflected on his relationship with Kanye West and J Dilla in recent months.
Earlier this year, the veteran MC reminisced about the pair “bonding” at his house before Dilla’s tragic death in 2006.
“I remember Kanye coming over to the crib where Dilla and I stayed,” Common told Hot 97, referencing the Los Angeles home he shared with the Slum Village member. “Kanye would sample Dilla’s drums off his beat tapes.

“Ye came over, it was Mother’s Day. We were going to a Mother’s Day brunch with Ye and his mother and my mother and then Dilla was at the crib. Ye was talking to him and they was just bonding, and then Dilla gave Ye these drums on a record.”
Common then remembered Kanye’s reaction to Dilla gifting him a beat tape: “I promise you, Ye was like, it was the golden chalice. We went to the studio later that day and Ye was telling Gee [Roberson], ‘Yo, Dilla gave me these drums!’ I forgot what song it ended up being but as soon as we got there, he was working on those songs.”

He added: “Dilla had a lot of love for Ye. And Ye had love for Dilla. It was great to see somebody who was as great as Ye just be like, ‘Dilla gave me these joints!’”
