In an interview with The Sunday Times, Snoop said: “Donald Trump? He ain’t done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me.”
Snoop praised Trump for pardoning Death Row Records co-founder Michael “Harry-O” Harris, who spent 30 years behind bars on an attempted murder charge and drugs offences.

In 2020, Snoop ripped into Trump in a YouTube video, saying: “So, me and my homeboys sittin’ up here talkin’ about all the people that President Trump disrespected. Women, gays, transgenders, Blacks, Mexicans, Asians, and now veterans. Hmmm. Seems like he’s disrespecting every color in the world and everything that ain’t what he is, which is a racist.”
“With that being said, the people that voted for him got exactly what they wanted,” he added. “They gave them what he said he was gon’ do. So, the next muthafucka, you better tell us what we gon’ get for your vote. You better show up and deliver, period.
