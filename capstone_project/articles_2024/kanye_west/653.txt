Padma Lakshmi appeared in a glittering ensemble, complemented by red carpet classic stiletto sandals featuring a modern update — espresso-colored patent leather — at the Gold Gala in Los Angeles on May 11. The Emmy-nominated producer and TV host wore minimalist footwear characterized by a slender strap across the toes and around the ankle, a rounded toe design, and an approximately 5-inch stiletto heel.
Lakshmi’s summer attire, styled by Adam Ballheim, originated from Cinq à Sept’s Spring 2024 collection featuring the sequined Jupiter top and skirt in “Fresh Lime”. The event adhered to a “heritage black tie” dress code.

The third annual Gold Gala, hosted by Asian Pacific community-focused non-profit Gold House, honored the “Taste the Nation” host and executive producer as a Gold Legend. The award acknowledges her “lifetime of indelible contributions to the success and representation of the Asian Pacific community.” She was also the star-studded event’s culinary director, and tapped New York City’s Michelin-starred Semma to create a love letter to her native South India.

Bang Si-Hyuk, the founder and chairman of K-pop super-label Hybe, was also honored with the Gold Legend award, as was actor Lucy Liu. Saweetie received the first-ever Billboard Gold Music award, “Beef” creator Lee Sung Jin and the Ali Wong-fronted cast were celebrated with the Gold Icon award.
The TV host, cookbook author, and former model prefers to enhance her 5-foot-9 stature with high heels. On the red carpet, she frequently complements her gowns with stiletto sandals, often choosing those in modern metallics or minimalist strappy designs. Whether filming “Taste the Nation” or during leisure activities at her local farmer’s market, she selects wedge espadrilles, heeled leather boots, or stylish sneakers.
Stiletto sandals are a red carpet mainstay, as their often-simple design and heel add elegance and go well with nearly any dress. The classic stiletto sandal features a simple strap across the toes and a fastener strap around the ankle, creating a barely-there construction. As trends change, stiletto sandal designs may reflect them, with different strap designs, materials, colors and even rhinestones or other embellishments. The heel of a stiletto sandal is often 4 inches or above, adding some height for a flattering silhouette.
