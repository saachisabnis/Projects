EVANSVILLE, Ind. (WFIE) - Evansville Police Department officials say a woman has been placed under arrested after she claims a well-known music artist told her to steal a car that had a child inside.
According to an affidavit, police were dispatched Friday morning to the 2000 block of North Main Street in response to a woman trying to get into random vehicles that were parked outside of businesses.
Officials say the suspect, later identified as Ricki Smith, tried getting into a woman’s vehicle when she was on her way into a store.
The victim saw Smith get into her car, grabbed Smith by the hair and pulled her out of the vehicle.
She told police she was dropping her child off at daycare and needed to stop at the store first and that’s when Smith jumped into her car.
According to Smith, she told police she was traveling from Louisville to Evansville and her car broke down on Highway 64, leading to her hitchhiking the rest of the way.
When police asked Smith why she tried to take the car, she said that Kanye West spoke to her telegraphically and told her to steal it.
Smith was arrested and taken to the Vanderburgh County Jail where authorities discovered that Smith had wrecked her vehicle into the tree line off Highway 64, which is why she stated that she abandoned her vehicle.
She is being charged with Attempted Kidnapping and Attempted Auto Theft.
We are still waiting for her mug shot to be released.
