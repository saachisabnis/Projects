His album 'Atavista' – an updated version of the previously released '3.15.20' – is said to be dropping soon
Childish Gambino a.k.a Donald Glover has previewed new music with Kanye West and Kid Cudi on social media.
The rapper, actor, writer and comedian took to Instagram Live for the latest edition of his GILGA Radio show, during which he previewed two new tracks, one featuring Kanye West, and the other featuring Kid Cudi.
On the first untitled track, Kanye raps about wanting to record a follow-up to 2011’s ‘Watch The Throne’ with Jay-Z. Kanye raps: “N****s waiting on The Throne like Hov say yes / I took my shoes out the store, they the new Payless / That’s the New God Flow, but I don’t pray less.”

It is currently unclear when these songs will be released, or which of the two upcoming Childish Gambino albums they’ll appear on.
Following the end of the Instagram Live session, Glover posted announced an upcoming tour, dubbed ‘The New World Tour’. Little else is known of the tour so far, but fans can pre-register their interest via thenewworldtour.com for updates.
A post shared by Donald Glover (@donaldglover)
Earlier this month, Glover revealed that he will release two more albums under the Childish Gambino moniker: ‘Atavista’ and ‘Bando Stone & The New World’. Glover also shared that ‘Atavista’ – an updated version of his previously released ‘3.15.20’ – will be dropping soon (though no release date has been shared at the time of writing). ‘Bando Stone & The New World’ will follow, and will double as the soundtrack for his upcoming movie of the same name, which is set to be released this summer.
‘3.15.20’ was awarded four-stars by NME when it was initially released in 2020: “Glover’s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.
“It’s an approach that Glover is applying to his musical output at least, with the impressive ‘3.15.20’ well worth the wait — we’ll keep our fingers firmly crossed, then, that he doesn’t give in to his past evasiveness and take the record down again…”
