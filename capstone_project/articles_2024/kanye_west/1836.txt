--------
Tariq Nasheed discussed his complex views on Kanye West and his encounters with Candace Owens. Nasheed expressed concern for West's apparent mental health issues, suggesting they might contribute to his controversial associations, such as with Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes. He criticized Owens for perpetuating narratives that fuel White supremacist justifications, particularly her claims about George Floyd. The discussion took a serious turn when Nasheed disclosed that the FBI had visited him multiple times. The visits seemed aimed at intimidating Black influencers across the country. The FBI inquiries linked Nasheed to figures like Michael Johnson, who shot cops in Dallas, and a man responsible for a subway shooting in New York. Nasheed clarified he had no personal connections with these individuals, viewing the FBI's actions as attempts to unsettle Black voices.
