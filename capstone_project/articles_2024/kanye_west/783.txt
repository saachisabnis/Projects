The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and included hits like “Independent Women Part I” and the title track “Survivor.”
In 2003, Beyoncé launched her solo career with the release of her debut album, “Dangerously in Love.” The album was a massive success, earning her five Grammy Awards and featuring the chart-topping single “Crazy in Love,” which featured Jay-Z.
