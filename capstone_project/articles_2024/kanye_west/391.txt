‘She is truly surprised’ 
Kanye West’s wife Bianca Censori is forever making headlines due to her outfit choices and concerns for her wellbeing after allegations Kanye was “dehumanising” her thanks to her minimal wardrobe. And after Bianca has been spotted spending more time with Kanye’s children in recent weeks, many fans have been wondering what his ex Kim Kardashian makes of his wife.
When the pair married in December 2022, Kim posted in a mysterious Instagram story: “I’m really in my quiet girl era, I don’t have much to say. Just much to do…Just remember, the black sheep usually turns into a goat. Keep doing you.” But, obv, that was a long time ago now. So, here’s everything you need to know about how Kim and Bianca’s relationship has evolved since then:

Apparently, when Kanye and Bianca first first got together Kim was did not like her whatsoever. In fact, Page Six went so far as to say Kim “hates” Kanye’s wife, adding Kim had apparently sensed some chemistry between Bianca and Kanye while they were still together. “She’s pretty. And Kim hates pretty girls,” their source claimed at the time.
Months later, sources told the Daily Mail Kim wasn’t a fan of Bianca because of the way she dressed when she was around her children. Bianca has routinely made headlines for her wardrobe, which have caused concern amongst fans that Kanye has a “humiliation kink” and is using fashion to embarrass her. “Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids,” the insider said. “She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.”

In recent weeks, Bianca appears to have been wearing more modest outfits – like fur coats and T-shirts – when spending time with Kim’s children. However, the close bond Bianca and North appear to have formed is allegedly making Kim uncomfortable too, as she fears her kids could wind up preferring Bianca to her. “Kim thinks Bianca is getting too close to her daughter,” an insider told OK! adding she was “definitely jealous” of North’s relationship with her step mum.

Regardless of the rumours of a feud, Bianca and Kim appear to be making their family situation work as earlier this month they were seen standing next to each other at Kanye’s Vultures Listening Party. They were both filming and chatting and, despite their fans’ surprise, appeared to be getting on fine. “Didn’t expect that,” reacted one shocked person on Twitter/X. “What on earth could they be talking about?” questioned another.
