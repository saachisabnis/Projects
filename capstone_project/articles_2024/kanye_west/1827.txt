Looks like the rapper formerly known as Kanye West will be forwarding his mail to a ritzy new Beverly Hills address. Ye just snatched up a 35-million-dollar mansion in Beverly Park North, an exclusive gated community where more is definitely more. According to Forbes, homes in the area average 20,000 square feet and will run you somewhere in the neighborhood of 24 million dollars. You can only get to the area through one of two guarded checkpoints, which makes it perfect for people who value their privacy. Actors Denzel Washington and Eddie Murphy, as well as baseball legend Barry Bonds, are just a few of the stars who have called the area home.
According to TMZ, Ye’s new 20,000-square-foot crib sits on approximately seven acres and has a massive 11 bedrooms and 18 bathrooms. The outside of the home is just as impressive, with a pool and paddle tennis court. Although we haven’t seen the inside, the outlet got an aerial view of the space, which could probably be seen from space.
Although Ye has the keys, there’s no telling if or when he’ll move in – or what he’ll do to the place when he does.
You may remember in 2021, Ye purchased, a 57 million-dollar beachfront mansion in Malibu. This is what it looked like when he bought it:
After he bought it, the rapper gutted the home, removing windows, doors and the entire kitchen. This is what it looked like after:
After sitting abandoned, Realtor.com reported that Belwood Investments purchased the “Jesus Walks” rapper’s home in September of this year for 21 million dollars and planned to give the home a facelift after calling some of Ye’s design decisions “dumb.”
“My goal is to make it as though Kanye was never there. The house will be restored right back to what it was,” said CEO Bo Belmont.
