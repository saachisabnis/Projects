Sharing Elliott’s post on her own Instagram account, Taylor reflected on Warwick’s enduring impact and legacy in the music industry.
“Ms. Dionne Warwick… A woman of great statue, poise and elegance, with a fiery spirit — Realizing I was looking at my future self,” Taylor wrote. 
Warwick, born on December 12, 1940, in East Orange, New Jersey, emerged from a deeply religious and musical upbringing. Raised in a household where gospel music flourished, Warwick’s early exposure to the industry shaped her destiny. At 14, she formed The Gospelaires with her sister and cousin, honing their craft in local venues before gaining wider recognition at the Apollo Theater.
Her breakthrough came in 1962 when Burt Bacharach discovered her during a recording session, leading to a string of hits like “Don’t Make Me Over.” Warwick’s distinctive voice bridged R&B and pop genres, earning her unprecedented success with 12 consecutive Top 100 hits from 1963 to 1966.
Warwick became the first African-American solo female Grammy winner for “Do You Know the Way to San Jose” in 1968, according to The Historymakers. Her activism, notably in AIDS awareness, and diverse career spanning music, television, and entrepreneurship, solidify her legacy as an influential icon.
The biopic announcement of the shoot date comes after Taylor first revealed her involvement in the biopic during an appearance on the Tamron Hall Show last year. In the interview, Taylor spoke candidly about her admiration for Warwick and her commitment to portraying the legendary artist with authenticity and respect. “We’re already working on it,” Taylor revealed.

Me, her, and her son [Elliott],” Taylor said, Billboard reported. “I mean, I’ve always been a firm believer in just always standing on safety. She’s had a wonderful career, you know, and I think right now it’s about making her feel as safe as possible so she can tell her story. A lot of these stories get misconstrued or extremely dramatized to an extent and that’s not where we want to go.”
