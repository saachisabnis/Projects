Tyla
Tyla, the South African singer who took the global music scene by storm, has quickly become one of the year’s biggest breakthroughs. Fusing the infectious rhythms of Afrobeats and Amapiano with contemporary R&B and pop influences, Tyla’s unique sound, dubbed "popiano," is a captivating blend that’s impossible to ignore. Her viral hit, “Water,” not only became a worldwide sensation but also reshaped the landscape for African artists in the mainstream.
The sultry track, with its irresistible hook and catchy, melodic charm, sparked a global dance trend on TikTok, further cementing her place as a cultural force. As the song climbed to No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, Tyla made history, becoming the highest-charting African female solo artist on the chart, surpassing the legendary Miriam Makeba’s previous best with “Pata Pata” in 1968. With remixes from superstar collaborators like Travis Scott and Marshmello, “Water” continued to dominate the airwaves, earning Tyla her first Grammy Award in the newly introduced category for Best African Music Performance.
At just 22 years old, Tyla is already poised to elevate her career even further. Her newest single, “Push 2 Start,” showcases her evolving sound and lyrical depth and has once again created a viral TikTok trend. Tyla is ready to make a lasting impact on the U.S. charts and continue to push the boundaries of African music on a global scale. As she continues to break barriers, Tyla’s growing influence signals a new era for African artists in the Western mainstream, and she’s just getting started.
BigXthaPlug
BigXthaPlug is already one of the most exciting rappers to emerge from Dallas, and while he may be too big for this list — with his hit “Mmhmm” charting on the Billboard Hot 100 and over 10 million monthly listeners on Spotify — he’s still in the process of blowing up on a larger scale. While he hasn’t yet had a viral, crossover smash that grabs everyone's attention, his 2023 rookie run proved that he's one of the most promising new talents in rap, rivaling the best of the year.
With standout projects Amar and The Biggest, BigX established himself as an undeniable force with a booming, unmistakable voice that can dominate any beat. But what really sets him apart is his ear for music. A self-professed R&B fan, BigX cleverly samples soul classics in his tracks, flipping Shuggie Otis’ string-heavy “Texas,” Marvin Gaye’s smooth vibes for “Climate,” and even The Whispers’ signature sound for “Mmhmm.” Notably, he reimagined the same sample used by Will Smith and The Trackmasters for “Miami,” but with a distinctly Texas-sized twist.
As his sound continues to evolve and his fanbase grows, it’s clear BigXthaPlug is on the verge of even greater success. His blend of raw energy and soulful ear positions him to become one of rap’s next superstars.
