Metro Boomin has taken his skills to the advertising world, appearing alongside wrestling star Cody Rhodes to promote an upcoming WWE event.
On Saturday afternoon (July 6), the musician took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the new commercial spot, which he captioned: “we just getting started! @CodyRhodes @WWE #badblood [blood emojis].”

The 45 second ad finds Metro and Rhodes sitting in an old school Ford Crown Victoria in a section of Downtown Atlanta known as The Gulch, giving them a direct line of sight to Phillips Arena. The two exchange a few lines about their mission, with the Atlanta transplant showcasing his comedic timing.
Following the exchange between the two, Metro Boomin and Future‘s song “GTA” comes in as a parade of WWE stars take over the screen before revealing the event, Bad Blood, which is set to take place in Atlanta on October 5.

Metro Boomin has always been one to explore his interests outside of music. His proximity to the superhero universe, specifically, is no secret, and he has now directly inserted himself into it.
On June 14, the inaugural issue of The Metroverse comic book series will be available to purchase via a dedicated site created for the project. Written by Ryan Cady and illustrated by Vasilis Lolos, the first installment is titled “The Rise” and will feature a superhuman version of the Missouri native going up against a tyrannical media mogul.

Only 4,000 copies of the standard edition have been printed for the opening run, though the item will also be sold at a Complex pop-up in Los Angeles the day before it goes live online. Each package will come with an art print and enamel pin.
His current sentiments about the state of the music industry may also be behind Metro’s desires to diversify the ways in which he profits from his many talents.

Last month, he raised the prospect that his future albums may not be released on streaming services.
Speaking on Instagram, the super-producer shared a post which said: “A fan needs to stream an artist’s music 20 times a day for a whole year for that artist to make $25 from a fan.”

Metro wrote over the post: “This is why my next album will probably be the last one streaming.”
Metro is not the first artist to question continuing to release music on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music.
