Kanye West is being sued for striking an autograph dealer in downtown Los Angeles in January of 2022 in an incident that was partially captured on video. The accuser says West shouted, “I’m going to make a fu-king example of you,” and referenced his split from Kim Kardashian, before hitting him. The man asked for an apology, and West allegedly replied “Apology for what?” before repeatedly striking him again and “severely injuring him.” When a member of his entourage told West to stop, he yelled “go to the fu-king house and get my fu-king kids.” The autographer dealer is suing for damages, claiming he suffered emotional suffering as a result of West’s assault and battery. He was not seriously injured in the incident.
