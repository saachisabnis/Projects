With four children, Kim Kardashian knows the pain of childbirth, so when she experienced a gruesome injury she said was even more painful than that, you know things are bad. 
In a preview for next week's episode of The Kardashians, the SKIMS founder can be seen visiting a doctor's office where she revealed she suffered an injury and sliced the middle finger of her left hand, per People. Her ring finger also appeared to have some cuts, but not nearly as bad as the other. Entertainment Tonight also shared a photo of the gruesome injury, but it could prove to be too much for anyone a bit squeamish.
In the clip, the doctor can be seen removing the bandage on Kardashian's finger during a checkup, telling her that the injury "looks great." However, the American Horror Story star wasn't completely convinced by the reaction, incredulously asking, "You think that looks great?"
"The, like, tip broke off," she explained in a confessional as she showed an X-ray of her sliced finger, claiming that the injury "was more painful than childbirth."
And Kardashian has the experience to back that up as understands the pain of childbirth given she shares four children with ex-husband Kanye West: North, 11, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 5. 
As of Thursday (July 11), it's unclear exactly how she cut her finger so severely, but Kardashian is likely to share more information about the injury in the next episode of her family's Hulu reality show, airing Thursday, July 18.
