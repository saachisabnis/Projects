Kim Kardashian's social media profile is taking a hit in the wake of Taylor Swift dropping a new diss track about the reality star on 'The Tortured Poets Department' album.
Only a few days after the track's release, Kim has lost more than 100,000 fans on social media.
Swift's new song, 'thanK you aIMee', is capitalized because it is a barely disguised anthem of revenge against Kim. Swift has called out a bully from her past in the song, calling the woman a "stump of bronze that has been spray-tanned."
One fan said on Instagram, "Finally, someone stood up to Aimee." Another user said Kim should have apologized in 2016 after attempting to paint Swift as a liar by disclosing a private chat between the singer and her ex-husband, Kanye West.
However, not everyone has seen this new diss track negatively. According to several Kim's fans, this song has only increased the SKIMS mogul's fame.
Some have called Kim's mother, Kris Jenner, to reply to the diss track on the family's Hulu show to capitalize on the drama.
Kim still has 363 million followers on Instagram, so losing 100,000 followers on social media is barely anything for Kim.
It is no secret that Swift is still furious with Kim after all these years. In her 'TIME' Person of the Year cover story, she called out Kim for trying to get her canceled.
She said, "You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar ... That took me down psychologically to a place I'd never been before."
For the most part, Kim has shrugged off the drama, although this could be because North West, Kim's daughter, is a fan of Swift, which TS references in 'aIMee.'
