Promoters for Rolling Loud California announced the addition of rappers Ye (Kanye West) and Ty Dolla Sign, who will now perform a special set on Thursday, March 14.
Under the name ¥$, Ye and Ty Dolla Sign are the only performers scheduled for the newly added date (the festival was already set to take place March 14-17) at Hollywood Park in Inglewood. Promoters also shared via X, formerly Twitter, that the Thursday event would be a half day affair as the duo, which just released the album “Vultures 1,” is set to bring out more special guests.
All current three-day passholders will be given access to the Thursday night performance at no cost via an RSVP link sent on behalf of the festival. All single-day pass holders will receive an email on Friday, Feb. 16 with a special link giving the option to upgrade to a three-day pass with Thursday access. Three-day passes are still available at RollingLoud.com.
Rolling Loud previously announced its lineup with headliners Nicki Minaj, Post Malone, Future and Metro Boomin. Acts include YG & Tyga, Partynextdoor, Bryson Tiller, Summer Walker, Rae Sremmurd, Flo Milli, 03 Greedo, Big Sean, Don Toliver, Sexyy Red and more.
