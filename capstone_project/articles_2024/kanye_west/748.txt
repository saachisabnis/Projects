Kim Kardashian surprised fans by addressing long-standing Tom Brady dating rumors during Netflix's most recent live special, Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, which aired on Sunday, May 5th. 
According to People, rumors of the pairing surfaced in May 2023 when Kardashian was reportedly searching for a vacation house near Brady's in the Bahamas. While a "source close to the Kardashians" released a public comment denying the relationship days after rumors started, Kim herself did not address the situation...until now. 
"Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not. I'd just release the tape," the icon teased, poking fun at her 2007 sex tape. She proceeded, drawing attention to her stepdad, Caitlyn Jenner. 
"I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair, you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you would want to undress me, just to try on my clothes." The entertainment icon continued: 
"Honestly, it's hard for me to watch people roast you, but I think enough of my family members have helped defend former football players." Brady also took a moment to roast Kim, highlighting the "real reason" that she was terrified to be at the event. 
"I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight. Not because of this, but because her kids are at home with their dad," the former NFL standout commented in reference to Kardashian's ex-husband Kanye West. Other celebrities present at the roast included Will Ferrell, Kevin Hart, Nikki Glaser, and more.
