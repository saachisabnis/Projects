Kanye West dominates the Hot 100 this week, though not with a new No. 1. The controversial rapper and his collaborator Ty Dolla $ign claim the most space on the chart this frame thanks to the immediate popularity of their joint album, Vultures 1. As the two own a bevy of new wins on the tally, the hip-hop powerhouse advances on an all-time ranking and passes one of his colleagues.
This week, West and $ign debut 16 songs on the Hot 100. All those tunes are featured on Vultures 1, which sends its entire tracklist to the ranking of the most-consumed tracks in the U.S. Those quick hits bring West’s career total to 157 appearances on the tally.
With 157 Hot 100 hits now to his credit, West advances on the list of the musicians with the most wins on the chart in history. He now sits in sixth place. Before Vultures 1 arrived, he was in seventh, but now he’s passed his closest competitor.
Thanks to his 16 new Hot 100 hits, West pushes past Nicki Minaj on the ranking of the artists with the most smashes on the chart. His friend and frequent collaborator has thus far snagged 148 hits on the ranking throughout her years as a superstar.
West and Minaj share three Hot 100 hits together. They pair have collaborated on the successful songs “Mama” with 6ix9ine (No. 43), “Dark Fantasy” (No. 60), and perhaps most memorably, “Monster” (No. 18).
Minaj also recently added to her historic total. In December, she released her long-awaited new album Pink Friday 2. That project sent quite a few songs to the Hot 100, upping her count significantly.
While he may have surged on this all-time list, West still has a long way to go before he bests all musicians in U.S. history. Drake currently leads this charge, as he’s accrued 328 Hot 100 hits. The Canadian rapper remains the only act to collect at least 300 wins. Taylor Swift sits in second, with 232–for now. Next up on this ranking are the cast of the TV show Glee (207), Lil Wayne (186), and Future (168).
