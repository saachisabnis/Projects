Kanye West and his wife, Bianca Censori, are entering the new year with a new style.
On Jan. 2, West posted a series of pictures of Censori in different outfits on his Instagram, with most of them showing off her body.
In the first picture, Censori is shown posing with a furry top, high heels, a g-string, and a headscarf, as West captioned the picture saying “No pants this year.”

In the next post, West and Censori are standing next to each other in black leather clothes, but Censori also has on a small bikini top that is most revealing.
The third picture shows Censori alone in the bathroom looking down at the floor with the same bikini top and a leather corset, and West captioned it “Dropped sumn?”
Users on Instagram called out West for showing off the provocative pictures and mentioned the one time that he called out Kim Kardashian for her Skims apparel line being overly sexualized, saying that he didn’t want to see his wife or daughters wearing certain things in order to sell products.
“Have you no respect for women,” one user said. “That’s the message that you’re sending out. Don’t you have daughters?”
West has been gearing up for his album Vultures to be released soon, and it seems as though he’s trying to get as much attention as he can so more people will tune in.
