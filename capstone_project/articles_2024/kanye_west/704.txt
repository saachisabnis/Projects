The girl who was too busy focussing on her walk to pick up her certificate is so real 
Congratulations, class of 2024! Graduations are well underway and finally, the tears and trauma were all worth it. Grads all across the country right now are frolicking in their gowns, tossing their sweaty caps and waving bye to campus for the last time. It’s bound to be one of the proudest and happiest days of your life – but for many grads, it’s just not as simple as that. Among the smiles, cheers and waves there is also chaos. So much of it. Maybe it’s the high emotions of the day or perhaps it’s just silly student antics, but the 2024 graduation chaos is in full swing. Here’s a look at some of this year’s graduation mayhem.

Now this might seem like a really silly thing to do, but there are actually loads of unis which don’t give out certificates on stage so I think we can cut her some slack. Loughborough University graduate, Deborah, walked right past the staff member holding her certificate outstretched, instead focussing completely on her walk. It was only when her friends watching her graduate texted her to let her know she forgot to pick up the certificate that Deborah clocked on. But I have to give it to her, that walk is pretty sensational. Regardless of what I think, her video has over 1.4 million views so she’s definitely made her desired impact.

It literally can’t get worse than this. One unlucky Nottingham Trent University student experienced both highs and lows on his graduation day when he fell over trying to capture a picture. Photography student Tom Dines was caught on camera tossing his cap into the air, but fell back and stumbled down a slope instead of catching it. Tom sprained his ankle but still made it out after the ceremony for celebrations. He might need to rethink those angles if he’s pursuing a career behind a camera.

This is graduation mayhem if I ever saw it. Imagine lining up to collect your degree but the gal ahead busts out a full on dance battle with the chancellor? And it’s not like he’s any other chancellor – it’s bloody Lenny Henry. This is iconic in every sense of the word but I’m not sure how I feel about the Ice Spice track over the video. Is Lenny big on hip hop?

A graduation and proposal in one day? My emotions couldn’t handle it. 23-year-old Joe Walters popped the question to his girlfriend of six years at his graduation from Bath Spa university on Monday in what he described as “the perfect moment to propose”. I mean, hats off to him. My graduation was all me, me, me so he’s pretty selfless to share the spotlight on his big day. After studying sociology for three years he is clearly much more emotionally intelligent than I am.
at least my walk ate, NEED to get that footage tho😭 #graduation #ukgraduation #grad

Ok I have to give it to her – this walk was made for the catwalk. But points gained on sass are lost in execution when this student completely missed the camera she was trying to lip sync a Kanye song to. What could’ve been an iconic Good Morning lip sync moment was instead just awkward eye contact with one poor camera guy whilst the guy actually filming didn’t get a glimpse in. Still, it’s a graduation to remember.

Why isn’t this concept more widespread? I get that it’s not the most traditional graduation ceremony but rolling out the red carpet and letting the graduates strut across a cheering crowd? It’s got Brat written all over it. This group of UAL students literally couldn’t resist a cheeky selfie or TikTok whilst parading over the carpet. It’s probably chaos for organisers who are trying to catch the best angles and market the ceremony and it might look odd to all of us watching but I bet that TikTok video is gonna be fire. Out of all the 2024 graduation chaos moments, you can’t get more Gen Z than this.
