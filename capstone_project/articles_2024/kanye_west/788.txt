Travis Scott will return to Coachella in 2025, marking eight years since he’s appeared at the popular festival.
Going down April 11-13 and April 18-20, the rapper will both perform at and curate the festival, in a move billed as “Travis Scott Designs The Desert.”

A press release Scott shared on Wednesday (November 20) revealed some more details, announcing that the rapper’s “Cactus Jack desert takeover” will “curate a fully immersive and experiential world within the desert.”
It also revealed that Scott will be performing on the Saturday night bill on both weekends, where he “will debut an entirely new era of music to the world.”

In addition to Scott, Post Malone, Green Day and Lady Gaga will headline Coachella, with additional acts including Missy Elliott, Ty Dolla $ign, Mustard, Three 6 Mafia, Megan Thee Stallion and more.
You can view the full lineup below.
Travis Scott was originally set to headline Coachella in 2020, but the entire event was scrapped amid the COVID pandemic. He was then rescheduled for 2022, but later taken off due to the Astroworld tragedy happening in late 2021.
An online petition calling for Scott’s removal from Coachella amassed over 70,000 signatures, citing his “gross negligence and sheer lack of compassion for human life” during the Astroworld tragedy.

He was then replaced by Kanye West, and it was rumored Travis would be joining him on stage – before Yeezy dropped out of his headlining slot mere weeks prior to the festival.
In a subtle response, fans driving to the Indio, California festival grounds were greeted with multiple billboards teasing Travis’s UTOPIA album.

Allegedly located on the I-10 highway in Palm Springs, the series of four billboards contain the messages “Psst……. Looking for UTOPIA? WRONG WAY!” followed by the logo of Cactus Jack, Scott’s record label.
Photos of the billboards were later posted on Cactus Jack’s official Instagram page with Coachella tagged as the location.

Fans in the comments section certainly seemed to find the location of the billboards amusing, with one writing, “Crying at this being on the road to Coachella.”

In addition to Coachella, Travis Scott will be a part of Monday Night Raw when the WWE makes its Netflix debut in January.
While performing at ComplexCon on Sunday (November 17), La Flame was joined on stage by Triple H, who now serves as WWE’s Chief Content Officer.

In video captured from the moment, Triple H can be seen handing Travis what he called the “Hardcore Champion” title belt before Travis asks, “When’s the first time I can put this to the test?”
“The first date for that [is] January 6 [in] Los Angeles, California,” Triple H replied. “Live to the world on Netflix at the Intuit Dome.”

Sharing the clip to X afterward, Triple H added: “When we say WWE goes big, we mean it. The first #WWERaw of the @netflix Era will be at the @IntuitDome in Los Angeles on January 6th, and @trvisXX will be there live and in person. The countdown is on…”
A press release from Netflix on Monday (November 18) revealed that Travis will also be creating a new theme song for RAW. While they didn’t note what he will be doing exactly on January 6, it seems likely that he will perform the track that night.
