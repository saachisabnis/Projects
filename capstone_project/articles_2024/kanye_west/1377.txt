Kanye West‘s “All Mine” contained a particularly horny reference to former porn star Stormy Daniels, but despite the rap legend’s appetite for adult content, it wasn’t actually him who wrote it.
Longtime Kanye collaborator Consequence unearthed his reference track for the ye album cut on Tuesday (June 11), posting a snippet of the original version on X (formerly Twitter).

The 45-second clip finds the Queens, New York rapper spitting sexually-charged rhymes over the sparse, 808-heavy beat and channeling his inner Yeezy as he says the line: “You my Naomi Campbell meets Stormy Daniels/ You could be 10 years older, I’ll be Corey Gamble.”
On the final version, Ye tweaks the line to: “If I pull up with a Kerry Washington/ That’s gonna be an enormous scandal/ I could have Naomi Campbell/ And still might want me a Stormy Daniels.”

In his tweet, Cons wrote: “All Mine Reference. This is where YE got the Stormy Daniels’ line. All Mine now has surpassed 500 Million Streams on @spotify. HIT MY LINE IF YOU NEED A SAMPLE.”
He then plugged an upcoming collaboration with West, adding: “No Apologies featuring YE. Dropping 06.21.24. [two flame emojis].”

Consequence is currently readying a new album called Nice Doing Business With You, which features another Kanye collaboration called “Blood Stain.”
The former G.O.O.D. Music MC dropped the hard-hitting, soul-sampling song back in 2022 and hailed it as one of Ye’s finest moment behind the boards, calling it the “beat of the year.”

While Cons and Ye are no strangers to sharing ideas in the studio, the “All Mine” demo comes after a flood of other reference tracks leaked, most notably from Drake’s vault.
After Vory’s demo for “Mob Ties” leaked at the end of May, one for the PARTYNEXTDOOR-penned “Ratchet Happy Birthday” also surfaced.
