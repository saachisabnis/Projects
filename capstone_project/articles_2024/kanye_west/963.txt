Kanye West's album releases can be quite tiring, as fans often wonder if and when a new project will actually be released. Many are excited about his upcoming solo album, Bully, but skepticism remains, especially since heâ€™s asking fans for money. He has started pre-orders for the album, offering digital or vinyl versions for $20 each. Additionally, there are shirts available featuring the album cover and gothic-style text of the album's name. Will this album actually come out, or will it end up like Yandhi, despite the pre-orders being available? If you're interested, you can find the details through the link below.
Right now, there are many theories about Kanye that aren't related to Bully. One rumor involved his supposed divorce from Bianca Censori, but that talk quickly faded. They have been seen together several times since the rumors began, and a recent photoshoot suggests their relationship is stronger than ever. Unfortunately, other news about Kanye involves serious allegations, including claims of sexual assault. At this time, neither he nor his legal team has made any public comment about these accusations, and there have been no updates on the court cases. The lawsuit comes from a former assistant, Lauren Pisciotta, who claims that Kanye drugged and assaulted her at a party. It remains to be seen if these allegations will be resolved publicly or settled privately.
Supporters like Dame Dash are backing Kanye as more details about the allegations emerge, so it's important to be cautious about what is said. This applies to everything happening in his life right now, including his music and personal matters. The letdown of the VULTURES series adds to the mixed feelings, but it also creates some hope that this time things might turn out differently.
