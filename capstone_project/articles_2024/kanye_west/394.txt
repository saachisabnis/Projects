The music world is mourning the loss of gospel legend Cissy Houston, mother of the late Whitney Houston. A two-time Grammy Award winner, Cissy performed with musical giants like Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin during her illustrious career spanning over seven decades. She passed away Monday morning at the age of 91, in her New Jersey home, while under hospice care for Alzheimer’s disease. Her daughter-in-law, Pat Houston, shared the heartbreaking news, adding that Cissy was surrounded by her family in her final moments.
The family’s statement paid tribute to her strength, faith, and dedication to her loved ones and community: “Mother Cissy has been a strong and towering figure in our lives. A woman of deep faith and conviction, who cared greatly about family, ministry, and community. Her more than seven-decade career in music and entertainment will remain at the forefront of our hearts.”
In other entertainment news, Kanye West and his wife, Bianca Censori, may be on the verge of a split. Reports from TMZ suggest that the couple, who have been married for nearly two years, are experiencing significant difficulties. Sources close to Kanye say he’s been sharing plans to relocate to Tokyo and possibly pursue a divorce from Bianca.
Meanwhile, Miami Beach officials are reportedly in the final stages of rescinding Diddy’s Key to the City, which was awarded to him in 2015. This follows Diddy’s decision to return his Key to New York City back in June.
Diddy’s mother, Janice Combs, has spoken out regarding the legal and public scrutiny her son has faced. She called it “unbearable” to witness what she described as a “public lynching” of her son before he’s had a chance to fully defend himself. Acknowledging some of his past mistakes, she added, “Sometimes, the truth and a lie become so closely intertwined that it becomes terrifying to admit one part of the story, especially when that truth is outside the norm or is too complicated to be believed.” Janice also shared that Diddy’s legal team’s decision to settle a lawsuit involving an ex-girlfriend was a strategic choice and not an admission of guilt.
