Supermodel Anok Yai was left frustrated after losing the 2024 “Model of the Year” title to Alex Consani, the first transgender model to ever win the title. Anok subsequently requested not to be nominated for future British Fashion Awards and seemingly criticized industry biases in a now-deleted social media post that stirred controversy.
Anok, who was born in Egypt and raised in New Hampshire, USA, was nominated for “Model of the Year” at the British Fashion Awards, held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, UK every year.
The title, which Anok also did not win in 2023, has previously been claimed by fashion icons like Kate Moss, Georgia May Jagger, and Cara Delevingne.
This year, Anok was up against Alva Claire, Amelia Gray, Liu Wen, Mona Tougaard, and Alex Consani, The Daily Mail reported on Tuesday (December 10).

Upon not winning the title, once again, Anok posted an un-captioned photo of Kanye West famously interrupting Taylor Swift at the 2009 MTV VMAs, which fans interpreted as the model saying she had been snubbed by the British Fashion Council, as per The Mail.
The 26-year-old took to her X page (formerly known as Twitter) to slam the British Fashion Council directly.
In the since-deleted post, Anok wrote: “Alex [Consani], I love you and I’m proud of you. British Fashion Council, thank you but I don’t want it anymore.”

“If you have seen the effort that I’ve seen Alex put in; you would understand how proud I am of her. 
“But Alex can be proud and I can be exhausted at the same time. It doesn’t take away how much love we have for each other.”
Anok’s statement sparked divided reactions, as a Threads user wrote: “Oh no what a hit to the modeling world.”

“No wait no one cares if Anok Yai wants to be a petulant child because she didn’t win an award.”
A person commented: “She even thanks Alex, but rightly calls out the institution for the fight that Black and brown models have to put in even to get nominated.”
Someone else penned: “Her comments regarding not wanting the award have NOTHING to do with Alex winning, and DEFINITELY nothing to do with Alex being trans.”

“Anok Yai is my model of the year every year,” a netizen exclaimed. “Period. FULL STOP.”
A commentator added: “Anok Yai deserved to win more than anyone…”
An observer shared: “Hot take: Anok was not being ‘shady’ towards Alex; she basically said ‘it is what it is’ bc she’s been getting ROBBED of [the] model of the year for YEARS now and she’s accepted it.”

“But bc you guys like to read into everything a Black [woman] does and act as if we can’t be upset, yall are making her seem problematic.”
A separate individual chimed in: “I can understand her frustration. As much as it’s good to see trans visibility Alex Consani still falls into the stereotype of white, blonde beauty.”
Anok is the first model of South Sudanese descent and the second Black supermodel after Naomi Campbell to open a Prada show, Vogue reported in 2018.

Additionally, Models.com ranked Anok as one of the “New Supers” of this generation. She has walked runways for the industry’s biggest brands, including Versace, Max Mara, Fendi, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton.
Following Anok’s viral post, Teen Vogue‘s associate editor, Aiynaha Ishmael, wrote an article arguing that Anok voicing her frustration with the result “isn’t an attack” on Alex’s win.
She countered: “[Anok] rightfully should be frustrated. This is now her second year being nominated.”

“She lost the award in 2023 to model Paloma Elsesser — another deserving model and activist. 
“[Anok] has made an impact in the fashion industry, especially in the last three years. She’s become synonymous with what it means to be a high-fashion model. 
“Some on the internet, though, believe she hasn’t handled her loss the right way, arguing that her vocal advocacy for herself takes away from [Alex]’s win. But that is not true.”

Aiyanaha continued: “[Anok] can be upset at the institution, honoring her emotions while still being excited for [Alex]. 
“The dismissal of her feelings serves no one. For so long Black and brown women have been told to just be grateful to be in the room, especially when it comes to fashion. 
“But broadly, we can acknowledge that minorities are often expected to accept defeat with humility and grace, while white people get to be whole versions of themselves.”

“Because isn’t it enough that you were nominated? You shouldn’t expect to win.”
The writer went on to argue that the discourse around Anok’s reaction highlighted societal expectations for Black women to suppress vulnerability, tied to stereotypes of resilience and strength. 
While celebrating Alex’s groundbreaking win, Aiyanaha said it was equally valid to acknowledge Anok’s deservedness and frustration, pointing to a broader conversation about representation in fashion.
Alex Consani became the first transgender woman to win Model of the Year at the 2024 British Fashion Awards in London on December 2.

In her acceptance speech, the 21-year-old highlighted her hope for the future of the industry and how her accomplishment was a “big step in the right direction,” Bored Panda previously reported.
“I’m the first trans woman to win this award,” she said. “But I can’t accept this award without thanking those who came before me, specifically the Black trans women who really fought for the space I’m in today — Domonique Jackson, Connie Fleming, Aaron Rose Phillips and countless more who fought for the space that allowed me to flourish today.”
“Now, more than ever, it’s an important conversation that should be had about how to truly support and uplift one another within this industry, especially those who have been made to feel insignificant,” Alex continued. “Because change is more than possible — it’s needed.” 
Bored Panda has contacted Alex Consani’s representatives for comment.

No problem with the transgender issue, but Alex has that pale, anorexic, waif look that can hardly be considered healthy. She looks like a heroin addict. A bit sinister. Whereas Anok glows. We need more models like her.
Also Alex has no eyebrows, how has nobody noticed?
I hate that look. I don't know who thinks it's attractive. It makes everyone look like an alien.
Yeah, I may get downvoted for wording it so bluntly like this, but I think Alex is ugly. Anok is gorgeous and should have won.
I agree. Couldn’t care less that she’s trans, but Anok is much more attractive.
Alex looks like in a real - ill anorectic boy.
Why is the BP headline trying to push this as model is upset because a trans person won. At no point does she complain that she lost to a trans person, in fact she repeatedly congratulates them and the work they do. The issue she is upset about is that the awards nearly always go to people with the same look, pale white and blonde. She is upset about successful models who do not fall into that category not being recognised
Except they don't.
Last year a plus sized model won, and she was not pale white and blonde.
The year before was Bella Hadid, also not pale white and blonde.
2019 winner was Adut Akech, who is not at all pale white or blonde.
Naomi Campbell in 2017.
2015 Jourdan Dunn.
Happy to help by providing context.
Regardless of if she is right or wrong for thinking that awards are skewed towards that look, that doesn't change that she is not complaining about a trans person winning despite the way they are trying to push it
The timing of her outrage over not winning raises eyebrows, and then sharing an image of West, a well known Neo Nazi who has a bad history with trans people should be an easy tip off.
We are slowly learning that men can do everything better that women, even being women. /s
In real life, it is the oposite. This poor creature has nothing in common with standard man, not even woman.it is a ephemera from mode welt.
