Kim Kardashian is shedding (and showing) some skin.
The reality star shared a series of sizzling new snaps from her upcoming Skims swim collection, feature tons of snake-printed designs as well as a red-hot color offering.
Kardashian, 43, posed in a barely-there snakeskin two-piece with a matching long-sleeve tie cover up in one of the pics. 
She also rocked a bright red bikini, along with a one-piece in the same shade, as she pouted sultrily and allowed her wet hair to fall across her face. 
Some of the other pieces from the collection — which will be available to shop on April 17 — include a halter-style snakeskin dress and a black bikini with a strapless top. 
British photographer Nick Knight was tapped to “capture the collection in a style reminiscent of his classic and avant-garde fashion campaigns from the 2000s” according to a press release from the brand. 
The mother-of-four previously worked with Knight when she appeared on the cover of L’Officiel Hommes in 2013 with her then-boyfriend Kanye West, and on the cover of V Magazine in 2012. 
“this is so 2006 coded,” one fan commented on the Instagram post highlighting her new swim collection.

“the colors to these sets are retro era 2000’s,” another chimed in, while her sister Khloé Kardashian wrote, “Calm down you hot ass woman.” 
Khloé and Kim recently teased the new drop while on vacation in Turks and Caicos last week. 
She and Khloé, 39, were seen sunbathing in snakeskin swimsuits while on the tropical getaway. They went makeup free for the outing, with Kim even rocking a black cowboy hat as she lounged on the white sand.
“This ain’t Texas…it’s Turks,” she wrote on Instagram, referencing Beyonce’s new hit “Texas Hold ‘Em,” from her “Cowboy Carter” album.
Sisters Kylie Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian — plus the foursome’s collective dozen children — also joined on the tropical vacation, during which they celebrated True Thompson’s sixth birthday.
