Big Sean is feeling lighter these days, and it’s not just because he finally released his long-awaited album, Better Me Than You. Fans had been waiting for years, and the consensus is clear: the album, with its sharp lyricism and varied, soulful production, was worth the wait. But while the music is making waves, it’s Big Sean’s playful antics on Instagram Live that are stealing the spotlight.
Following the album’s release, Big Sean decided to have some fun on Instagram Live. In a light-hearted moment, he playfully mimicked Drake’s infamous “duck face” selfie. “I’m gonna do the Drake face,” he announced, attempting to replicate Drake’s well-known pout. He struggled to hold the expression for more than a few seconds without breaking into laughter. After another attempt, he laughed even harder, clearly enjoying the joke.
Sean’s playful jab comes on the heels of a recent Instagram post by Drake on August 28, where the Toronto rapper poked fun at himself for his duck face habit. In the post, Drake shared several examples of his own pouting selfies and included photos of others, such as YouTuber Duke Dennis and rapper-turned-podcaster Joe Budden, doing similar poses. In a humorous caption, Drake credited Dennis and Budden for influencing his expression: “I’m not aware of my picture or mirror face. It’s a curse from birth, and I’m influenced by what I see.”
Some might have seen Big Sean’s actions as throwing shade. However, it’s clear he was just having fun. Known for his laid-back demeanor, Big Sean usually avoids drama. The exception is his past friction with Kanye West or Kendrick Lamar. Despite the playful banter, Big Sean and Drake have maintained a neutral relationship. Sean rarely comments on Drake publicly. When he does, it’s often about how Drake’s career has indirectly affected his own. For example, his comeback single “Precision” was overshadowed by the Drake and Kendrick Lamar feud. Nevertheless, Sean has never shown personal grievances toward Drake. His recent antics appear to be more of a friendly joke.
