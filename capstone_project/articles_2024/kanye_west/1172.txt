 Kim Kardashian's daughter North West is teasing her debut album.

 The 10-year-old spoke briefly about what’s to come from her upcoming LP Elementary School Dropout in a rare on-camera interview, which was organized by Kardashian, 43, at Rolling Loud 2024 this week.

 In a video posted on Rolling Loud’s Instagram, North excitedly chatted with young reporter Jazlyn, aka Jazzy, about the album. The interview came a day after she performed during her father Kanye West’s set at the festival.

 “#NorthWest talks about her new album & collabs to expect 🎶,” Jazzy, who also posted the clip, wrote in the caption. “Thank you Ms. @kimkardashian for helping out 💕 📍 @rollingloud.”

 When asked at the beginning of the interview how she was, North responded, “Good, how are you?” She was then asked what everyone can expect from her album, to which she replied, “It’s going to be great.”

 “When is [the album] going to drop?” Jazzy grilled North further. Looking straight at the camera, North said, “Like … I don’t know.”

 Finally, Jazzy asked North if there are any collaborations with her dad on the album. North shrugged as she replied with a smile, “Maybe, we don’t know yet!”

 In a behind-the-scenes clip of the interview obtained by TMZ, North could be seen chatting away to Jazzy as mom Kardashian stood to the side keeping an eye on her eldest daughter. 

 North announced her debut album last week during a listening party for her dad's album Vultures 2, according to Forbes.

 Standing on stage in Phoenix, Arizona, North reportedly told the crowd, "I've been working on an album." She then explained the title of her album is a direct reference to her dad's 2004 album The College Dropout.

 On Thursday, North performed the song “Talking” off of West's new album Vultures at Rolling Loud. The preteen joined the rapper onstage to perform the track along with her best friends, plus cousin Penelope Disick, 11. 

 In fan footage of the performance posted on X (formerly Twitter), North could be seen walking to the center of the stage and then jumping around with her friends in a circle while her rapper dad, 46, stood to the side.

 Festival goers can also be heard loudly chanting the lyrics to her song in the crowd.
