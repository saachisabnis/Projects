American actress Edy Williams drew gasps from the crowds when she appeared at the 1986 Oscars draped in nothing more than pearls and a tiny white thong
The 2024Â Oscars are looming, and fans of fashion can't wait to see the latest red carpet looks from Hollywood's elite.
The American awards show, which first premiered way back in 1929, has showcased some outrageous outfits in its time - but perhaps none more so than Bjork's 2001 dress - which saw her walk the carpet masquerading as a feathered swan.
Bjork even simulated laying eggs, scattering six real ostrich eggs on the red carpet and causing confusion among security guards, who thought she'd dropped them accidentally and rushed to pick them up.
The outfit, by a then obscure Macedonian designer, included a life-like swan neck wrapped around the It's Oh So Quiet singer's own neck.
However, that's not where it ends - as other eyebrow-raising ensembles have included actress Edy Williams' barely-there dress, made entirely out of pearls, in the 1980s.
The skimpy dress would give Kanye West's increasingly scantily-clad wife Bianca Censori a run for her money, after she recently appeared publicly in sheer tights with no underwear on underneath.
There was also the moment when Gwyneth Paltrow shunned a bra and quickly regretted it, plus another when Natalie Portman let loose a political storm.
The star had donned a dress featuring the names of female stars who'd been shunned by the Oscars - and it didn't go down well with everyone.
Without further ado, let's take a look at some of the most eyebrow-raising outfits in Oscars history.
