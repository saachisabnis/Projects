Kanye West has been hit with a lawsuit by his former employees along with his ex-chief of staff, Milo Yiannopoulos. 
According to reports, the lawsuit states that employees were made to engage in “forced labot and cruel inhuman, or degrading treatment.” West’s wife, Bianca Censori, is also mentioned in the lawsuit for allegedly sending staff porn. 
The former employees are seeking money for unpaid wages as well as overtime pay, and emotional distress. This lawsuit came into play after the launch of the rapper’s digital music service, YZYVSN, which was set to go against Tidal, Apple Music, and Spotify. Ye and Yiannopoulos reportedly hired an international developer group which supposedly included minors as young as 14. 
The court documents also reveal that Yiannopoulos had promised to the pay the team $120,000 after they finished working on the app. However, they had to complete their tasks and without complaining. Things turned after employees said that West forced them to “sign non-disclosure agreements and told the minors they’d fired without pay if they didn’t sign on the agreement. 
Employees also claimed that they had to work long hours without pay or sleep. They also said that the minority and foreign employees were called “new slaves” and were met with dergatory language about their sexuality, race, age, and sexuality.  The employees later revealed that they finished the app but were never paid for it.
