	“Mama, look at my drawing!” “Mama, are you going potty?” “Mama, mama, MAMA!” Do you feel triggered? Moms can’t even go to the bathroom without their kids following them and talking relentlessly to them through the door. (Have kids, they said.) Kim Kardashian hit her limit recently with her four kids, so she hid in the closet to escape — and I’ve never identified with anything more.

	










	On this week’s episode of The Kardashians, the SKIMS founder opened up about the stressful situation. “I am a single mom of four, and it is wild,” Kardashian, who is mom to North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 5, with ex Kanye West, said, per Entertainment Tonight. “I almost feel like my kids have this radar where they know that I’m doing something really important. I thought I was going to end up on an episode of Snapped yesterday.”

	Seriously! I feel like every kid has this mom-is-busy-let’s-bother-her radar, and it’s so annoying. Recently, I had been waiting on an important phone call from my doctor, and my kids were perfectly quiet and happy in the car the entire time — until the call came, of course. As soon as I answered they started shrieking and assaulting me with a barrage of questions. It’s so frustrating!



	For Kardashian, she was doing an important virtual interview when her kids started banging on the door, prompting her to hide in her locked bathroom. “Oh my God. No, what I wanted to say was that I had a Zoom interview at the house with all my kids there banging on the door, just screaming,” she said in the episode, per PEOPLE. “And I was literally hiding in a bathroom with the door locked. And I was just like, ‘I can’t believe this.’ I mean, I can believe it.'”

	“I’m open to anything at this point because I can’t live like this. I ran out of patience and that’s what my superpower was, being calm and patient,” she added.

	Every single mom has been there (Melissa Joan Hart even has a dedicated “crying spot” when things get to her with her three kids.) It’s like kids know exactly how to push their mom’s buttons. You have to have the patience of a saint to deal with them!



	The American Horror Story: Delicate star said that her life “gets just a little intense” with the kids. “I want to be more strict like Khloé but I don’t know why I have a hard time just saying, ‘No is no.’ I think I also don’t want to deal with the whining and the tears of not getting their way,” Kardashian said. “They know when to con me and when to throw the little, you know, start with the tears so that I’m like, ‘Stop, stop. Sure. Take your iPad, you know, just stop.’ I just have to be like, ‘I don’t care if you’re gonna throw a tantrum in front of everyone. The answer is no.” That’s so hard to do, but so important too.

	Although most of us have never experience the majority of Kardashian’s luxe lifestyle, she has shared some relatable parenting moments recently. Earlier this week, she shared a photo of Psalm in his car seat. The little boy was dressed in a green Hulk costume, complete with a mask.

	“Sometimes this is the only way I can get my kids out of the door to go to school 💚🤣” she captioned it. “Can’t fight the fight today! Hulk it is!” Been there too, girl!

	We’re all just doing the best we can, and it’s nice to see that even billionaires deal with the same problems we do!
