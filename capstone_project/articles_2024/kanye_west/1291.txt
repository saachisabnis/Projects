Kanye West, Bianca Censori
Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori have been all smiles as of late.
The pair was recently spotted out again in Florence, Italy, following their Valentine's Day outing in the European country last week.
Similar to when they were publicly photographed on the February holiday, they were both seen sporting all black, yet again, with Censori keeping up her recent trend of being more covered up than usual.
The “Stronger” rapper and Yeezy architect were snapped smiling and chatting with each other while getting out of a car and walking around the Italian art scene on Monday, Feb. 19. The snaps are refreshing to see, as the duo more typically than not appear rather stoic.
The 29-year-old diverted from her usual racy oufits, appearing fully clothed in a black hoodie worn over her head with a near-floorlength, lightweight matching leather trench coat and thong sandal-boots. The Donda hitmaker, for his part, cut a casual figure in a black sweatsuit.

West and Censori—who tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Dec. 2022—are known for turning heads when they step out, with the latter often putting her bod on full display in risqué fashion ensembles.
Recently, the 46-year-old hitmaker defended his propensity to post immodest photos of his wife on social media, but shortly after, his eldest daughter with Kim Kardashian, North West, sparked concern among fans when she drew a picture of the duo, in which the native Australian was depicted wearing nearly no clothing.
As Parade previously reported, prior to that, the fashion-forward couple were spotted in a fresh set of matching 'fits when they took on Super Bowl 2024 on Sunday, Feb. 11, appearing at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas draped head to toe in more all black ensembles.
