Will Smith, the Grammy Award-winning artist, has released his new song “You Can Make It,” featuring Fridayy and the Sunday Service Choir. The song debuted with a lyric video on Thursday and was officially released on Friday.
In the track, Smith collaborates with Fridayy and the Sunday Service Choir, known for their work with Kanye West, to deliver an inspiring message about perseverance. As reported in Complex, Smith explains that a difficult journey leads to greater rewards, reflecting on his challenges, including the Oscars incident. 
“Believe me, they tried to bleed Will Smith,” he raps. “In the rearview, I see adversity was the gift. To lift me higher, gifts require faith. So dry your eyes and then you’ll find a way.” He also reassures listeners that “madness” will eventually fade and the “darkest of nights will turn into days.”
We’ve reported that Smith is set to perform this new track at the BET Awards on Sunday, marking his first major solo performance in years. 
Here’s what Connie Orlando, EVP of Specials, Music Programming & Music Strategy at BET said and how she expressed excitement about Smith’s return to the stage. “From his start as a rapper to The Fresh Prince to being a box office king as one of the Bad Boys, Will Smith is truly a global icon, and we are honored to welcome him back to grace the BET Awards stage,” she said. “We look forward to Will adding to yet another defining night for the culture that is not to be missed.”
