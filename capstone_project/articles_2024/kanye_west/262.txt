Travis Scott continues his iconic collaboration with Nike and Jordan brands, with several exciting releases planned for late 2024 and early 2025. Fans can look forward to the Air Jordan 1 Low “Medium Olive” this September and the Jordan Jumpman Jack “Mocha” in November.
Travis Scott Continues to Shape Sneaker Culture with New Jordan Releases for 2024 and 2025

Travis Scott holds the title of Nike, Inc.'s most influential collaborator. Each project he undertakes generates a devoted fanbase that few can rival. His recent performances in Milan and Rio de Janeiro, which shook the ground, further prove his cultural impact, suggesting that Scott is one of history's most significant brand collaborators.
The enduring popularity of Travis Scott’s Jordan releases is no surprise, as they appeal to a wide range of age groups. Scott's journey is far from over, and he has already left his mark on iconic models like the Air Jordan 1 Low, Air Jordan 4, and Air Jordan 6. With new releases like the Jordan Jumpman Jack and the Field Jaxx, speculation grows over whether he could follow Kanye West’s footsteps and establish his label under a major brand. While that remains uncertain, fans can look forward to more Travis Scott Jordans and Nikes arriving through the remainder of 2024 and into 2025.
One of the most anticipated upcoming releases is the Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP “Medium Olive,” confirmed for release on September 28th in full family sizes. Following closely in November is the Travis Scott x Jordan Jumpman Jack “Mocha,” featuring a brown and black colorway reminiscent of Scott’s earlier collaborations.
Closing out 2024, the Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP “Velvet Brown” is expected to be one of the most sought-after sneakers of the holiday season. It shares a similar color scheme to the Jumpman Jack “Mocha.” This “Velvet Brown” release is the final confirmed Air Jordan 1 Low drop.

Travis Scott’s 2025 Sneaker Lineup Promises New Jordan and Nike Releases Amid Canceled Drops
Looking ahead to 2025, additional Travis Scott Jordan and Jumpman Jack releases are expected, including the Muslin/Black/Bright Cactus colorway, although specific release dates have yet to be announced.
In addition to his work on the Jordan brand, Scott’s collaboration with Nike continues with the Zoom Field Jaxx, a model that blends elements of running shoes and baseball/turf trainers. Fans can expect four versions of the Field Jaxx, including the "Sail/White," which saw a limited release during All-Star Weekend, the "White/Light Chocolate," and two other colorways yet to be fully revealed.
Despite the excitement surrounding these releases, some anticipated drops have been canceled. The "Shy Pink" and "Dark Pony" colorways of the Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG SP, initially slated for Spring 2025, have been scrapped, as has the “Pale Vanilla,” which did not make it past the planning stages.
