Hanging by a thread… literally. Kanye West‘s wife Bianca Censori risked a significantly revealing wardrobe malfunction in an “un-Censori-ed” outfit while new reports suggest that Ye was working to mend relations with his spouse’s mother amid concerns over their marriage.
Bianca’s outfit left little to the imagination as she was spotted out and about in Los Angeles, USA, on Sunday night (March 17).
The 29-year-old architect nearly spilled out of her daring ensemble as her cleavage was merely held up by a see-through rubber strap, the Daily Mail reported.
Her outfit featured a daringly sheer neckline and stockings with garter straps, accentuating her curvaceous figure, and was completed with sheer heels.
Bianca appeared alongside her 46-year-old husband as they were reportedly seen hitting a drive-through at Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers in Burbank.

The couple’s sightings follow new reports that they have been working to “turn things around” with Bianca’s mother, Alexandra Censori, after she allegedly flew out to “save” her daughter over fears she was being controlled, insiders have claimed to the Daily Mail.
Alexandra reportedly flew from Australia to the US last week “to see for herself” whether her daughter truly does have everything under control amid Ye and Bianca’s infamous outings, which showcase immodest and sometimes even illegal outfits.
A source told the Daily Mail: “Bianca’s mom had to see for herself after Bianca told her family she has this under control.
“This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to get to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself.”

The insider continued: “Right now is a pivotal time and Alexandra was lowkey believing she would come to save her daughter. But this is not the case.
“Kanye has started to turn things around since the release of Vultures in the sense that he is not going off on as many unhinged rants.
“He also knows how to sweet talk a mom. This has been really a good experience, and everyone is so relieved to see her with Alexandra.”

A desire to be involved in the lives of any future grandchildren may also be a driving force, as per the Daily Mail.
The source said: “Alexandra knows that Bianca wants children, and she does not want to miss the opportunity to be a part of her grandkids’ lives.”
The news follows recent pictures taken of Bianca and her mom on Saturday (March 16) as the Aussie was wearing a baby pink satin minidress with an extremely short bottom edge, plunging neckline, and a crystal-lined halter strap.

Andréa - do you have some sort of weird fetish for these sick people that you feel the need to overshare about them with us? And multiple times a week? Let it go, girl. The trash can take itself out in this case.
You're just as bad as putting in the effort to have to make a comment and keep up to date. This is her JOB. Do you have any idea of what that is? Considering the amount of comments you make - I'd doubt it.
It's really pathetic of you to use this account to attack and insult readers who don't like your content. You should be embarrassed of yourself.
I know Bored Panda website is a curator of things, but could we not have things like this? Or a feature to block items tagged with particular words? I wish I could block celebrity articles.
Too bad there's no way for you to downvote it.../s

Stop giving these people attention.
