Ye,  the artist formerly known as Kanye West, has had all of his teeth covered with metal fixed prosthodontics valued at an estimated $850,000 smile, according to images the  pop culture provocateur posted on January 17 on his Instagram account.

In  later postings, Ye shared an image of his pointy new smile with one comparing himself  to the James Bond villain, Jaws. In the 1977 film, “The Spy Who Loved Me,” Jaws  was an assassin’s henchman who used his stainless teeth to attack and bite his  enemies. Jaws, who was known for his superhuman strength, returned to the 1979  flick “Moonraker” during which became an ally to Bond.
Ye and a team of dentists and cosmetic surgeons created the unique prosthodontics. Dr. Thomas Connelly, the celebrity dentist known  as the father of diamond dentistry, fitted his new smile. Connelly’s clients have included rappers, Post  Malone, and DaBaby.
Connelly  told the Daily  Mail that "Kanye was a pleasure to work with every step of the  process. His vision for  designing unique art transcends the dental progression. The marriage of his vision with dental science has created a new  look that is epic."
For Ye, blinging up smiles must run in the family.
In  June 2023, Saint West, the 7-year-old son of Ye and Kim Kardashian, wore tooth  jewelry displaying the Louis Vuitton logo on his front teeth ahead of the Paris  Fashion Week men’s show. The jewelry showed the designer’s infamous logo, which  is a hand-drawn letter V overlapping the letter L.
