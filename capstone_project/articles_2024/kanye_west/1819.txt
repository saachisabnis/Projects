	“Happy 6th Birthday Chicago!” The Kardashians star began her caption. “I honestly didn’t know too much about what raising a Capricorn girl would be like but you make it so easy and fun and silly!!! I can already see the determination and ambition you have within you,” the mom of four wrote, highlighting a few traits associated with the winter zodiac sign. 



	“You are so smart, sweet, silly and so lovable to everyone around you especially your cousins!” Kardashian continued. “It’s magical to see you all together and all the love that exists between the tribe. I love you so much Chi Chi and can’t believe you are 6 years old! 🩷 I’m so so so happy to be your mommy!” she lovingly concluded.
