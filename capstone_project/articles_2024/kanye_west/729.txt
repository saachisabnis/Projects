Adidas saw strong growth in Greater China in the third quarter, while sales in North America excluding Yeezy shoes were up on the year thanks to improving brand image.
Adidas' performance in China contrasts with other companies that are struggling with weak consumer demand and a likely longer wait for government stimulus measures to boost confidence.
Currency-neutral quarterly sales rose 9% to 946 million euros ($1.02 billion) in Greater China, up from 870 million euros a year earlier, the company said on Tuesday - its strongest quarterly sales in China since the start of 2022.
Adidas shares gained 1.7% in early trading, despite a filing announcing top shareholder Groupe Bruxelles Lambert cut its stake. Adidas had already released preliminary figures and hiked its annual sales and profit guidance earlier this month.
A trend for Adidas' "terrace" shoes, retro models inspired by soccer fans' footwear in the 1970s and 80s, has driven sales at the German sportswear company, helping it gain market share over rivals such as Nike and recover from a bruising break-up with rapper Kanye West, who goes by Ye.
"In lifestyle, management is avoiding overflowing the market with Campus and Terrace," said Stifel analyst Cedric Lecasble, adding that Adidas is pushing its SL72 shoes and "low profile" sneakers such as its Taekwondo model.
In North America, Adidas' second-biggest market behind Europe, the Middle East and Africa, currency-neutral sales were down 7% at 1.36 billion euros in the third quarter, but increased from the previous year when excluding Yeezy, the company said.
The results are the latest evidence of a revival in the company's fortunes almost two years after CEO Bjorn Gulden joined the German brand. Gulden has overseen the sales of Adidas' stock of Yeezy shoes left unsold after cutting ties with the rapper, its former design partner.
Adidas' wholesale business - revenue made by selling product through third-party retailers - grew 13% in the third quarter, while direct to consumer sales grew 7%.
The company's gross margin increased by 2 percentage points compared to a year ago, at 51.3% - an impressive result, Jefferies analysts said, given the wholesale channel is generally less profitable.
Adidas has taken shelf space from Nike at multi-brand retailers such as Foot Locker and JD Sports thanks to the trend for its multi-coloured sneakers, while its US rival has seen sales fall.
