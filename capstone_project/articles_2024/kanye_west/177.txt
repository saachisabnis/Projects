Kanye West was responsible for remotely telling a woman to attempt to steal a car with someone already inside — or at least that’s what the suspect is reportedly claiming to police.
A Louisville woman named Ricki Smith, 28, was reportedly seen trying to get into a number of cars on Friday morning (August 30) on North Main Street in Evansville, Illinois.

According to authorities, Smith then tried to get into one woman’s car — a car that had the woman’s child sitting inside — while she was in a nearby store.
The car’s owner spotted Smith breaking in and pulled her out of the vehicle.

The police asked Smith why she attempted to take the car, and they claim she answered that Kanye had “telegraphically” ordered her to.
Smith is being charged with Attempted Kidnapping and Attempted Auto Theft. She is currently being held in Vanderburgh County Jail on $10,000 bond, with a hearing set for Thursday (September 5).

While West was reportedly being blamed for remotely getting into a woman’s mind, he was in reality working on bringing his Vultures listening experience to China.
While the post has since been deleted, Kanye announced earlier this week that he and his Vultures collaborator Ty Dolla $ign would put on a show in the country at an unnamed venue on September 15.

West and Ty were originally supposed to perform in Taiwan, which is in a governance conflict with China, but that listening experience was canceled without explanation just days before it was supposed to go ahead.
Growing up, Kanye briefly lived in China while his mother worked as a university lecturer at Nanjing University.

The most recent Vultures listening experience took place in South Korea where Kanye treated fans to hits from across his 20 year career.
He performed classic cuts such as “Gold Digger” and “All of the Lights” while also delving into more recent tracks such as “Ghost Town” and “Off the Grid”.

The South Korea show was most notable for what Kanye West did outside of the music as he addressed one of his favorite topics when speaking to the capacity audience.
During the sold-out gig, which opened with Kanye entering the Goyang Stadium on horseback, the Yeezy mogul surprised fans by showing love to on-again, off-again frenemy Drake.
