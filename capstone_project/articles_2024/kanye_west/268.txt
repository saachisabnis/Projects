Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's collaborative album, Vultures 1, remains at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 for a second week. This is West's first release to spend multiple weeks at the top since 2011's Watch The Throne with Jay-Z.
Yeat landed his highest-charting album yet as 2093 debuted in the No. 2 spot. The numbers were helped by the record's multiple reissues, and features from special guests like Future, Lil Wayne, and Drake.
Morgan Wallen’s former chart-topper One Thing At A Time rose back up to No. 3, Noah Kahan’s Stick Season slipped down one spot to No. 4, and SZA’s SOS rounds out the top five.
