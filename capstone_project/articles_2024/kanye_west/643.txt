Henry Cavill finds sex scenes "uncomfortable" to film and he thinks they are "overused" in movies.
The Argylle actor acknowledged intimate moments can sometimes be "great" to help with storytelling in movies, but ultimately the human imagination can "trump" anything depicted on screen anyway so feels they are usually unnecessary.
He told the Happy Sad Confused podcast: "I don't understand them, I'm not a fan.
"I think there are circumstances where a sex scene actually is beneficial to a movie, rather than just the audience.
"I think sometimes they're overused these days and it's when you have a sense where you're going, 'Is this really necessary or is it people just with less clothing on?'
"And that's where you start to get more uncomfortable and you're thinking, 'There's not a performance here, there's not a piece which is going to carry through to the rest of the movie.'
"I think sex scenes can be great in a movie, they can really help with the story telling, but most of the time the human imagination is going to trump it."
The 40-year-old actor accused filmmakers of opting for a "cop-out" by adding sex scenes where they are not needed.
He added: "So, it can be a little bit of a cop-out if a TV show or a movie is just filled with gyrating bodies and you're going, 'Okay, but what is this doing for us apart from the idea of oh, naked person, great.' [I'm] not a fan of doing them."
Henry previously admitted he was left embarrassed when filming a sex scene for The Tudors, in which he played Charles Brandon, at the age of 23 and he got an erection.
He told Men's Fitness magazine in 2015: "It's only happened to me once.
"A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn't rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She's basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard."
He apologized afterwards and admitted: "It's not great when you're in a professional acting environment and somebody gets [an erection] is it? No, not acceptable."
