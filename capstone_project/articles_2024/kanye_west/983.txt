Taylor Swift had 12 nominations at the VMAs 2024 but how many has she won overall and what for? Here's a look at all of Taylor's VMAs wins.
After Taylor Swift literally broke her own record at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2023 it's not surprising that the mega-star is led the 2024 wins taking home 7 Moon Man trophies in one might.
Her 'The Tortured Poets Department' song 'Fortnight' with Post Malone landed her most of the wins, and she also took home artist of the year.
The Taylor Swift VMAs lore runs pretty deep as we can't forget how in 2009 Kanye West jumped on stage when she was awarded 'Best Female Video', for You Belong with Me', and said, "I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!"
It acted as a canon event in Taylor's career and led her to write her 'TTPD' track 'thanK you aIMee'.
The 14-time Grammy Award winner officially became the artist with the most VMAs, surpassing Beyoncé who has 26, so let's take a look at how many she has and what she won them for.
The hugely successful musician has 30 VMAs to her name. Taylor won her second ever Video Music Award in 2013 and in 2023 she made history taking 9 trophies home.
In 2024 Taylor took home 7 trophies with six of them award for her 'TTPD' tracks Fortnight ft. Post Malone'. She didn't manage to break her own record but she has now become the artist with the most VMAs ever as Beyoncé comes in second with 26 to her name.
