Former President Donald Trump’s penchant for derisive nicknames has apparently rubbed off on current White House staffers, who refer to the presumptive Republican nominee as “Hitler Pig.” 
The “Hitler Pig” sobriquet is used frequently to describe Trump and generally by younger, tech-savvy, aides to President Biden, according to Politico. 
White House staffers and campaign aides first started using the term after Trump dined with rapper Kanye West and notorious Holocaust skeptic and white nationalist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago estate two days before Thanksgiving in 2022, according to the outlet.  
The moniker is usually deployed when the 77-year-old former president makes outrageous comments, such as when he appears to praise the murderous Nazi dictator.
“Hey, did you see what Hitler Pig said?” Biden aides will say in those situations. 
Some on social media mocked the nickname. 
“White House nickname for Trump is ‘Hitler Pig.’ How humorless and pathetic is that?” Marc Thiessen, former President George W. Bush’s speechwriter, wrote on X. 
“‘Pig Hitler’ is funnier though,” another user chimed in. 
Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita argued that the nickname is more of a reflection of the White House staffers that use it. 
“[Politico] thinks this is funny it’s actually more a representation of what a rag they’ve become and the level of s–t that works in the White House ‘Hitler Pig,’” he wrote on X.
