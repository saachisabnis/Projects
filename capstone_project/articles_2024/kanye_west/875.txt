Latest news on laughing gas, a common name for nitrous oxide, a colourless gas that can cause feelings of euphoria, relaxation and giggling when inhaled. It is used as a sedative and pain reliever in medical and dental settings, such as during labour or dental surgery. It is also used as a propellant for whipped cream and a fuel additive for cars.
However, laughing gas can also be misused as a recreational drug, especially by young people. It is usually inhaled from balloons filled with nitrous oxide from small canisters. This can be dangerous, as it can cause vitamin B12 deficiency, anaemia, nerve damage, paralysis and even death.
On 5 September 2023, the UK government announced that nitrous oxide will be categorised as a class C drug by the end of 2023 as part of its crackdown on anti-social behaviour.
