Kanye West didn’t hold back on his recently released album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 2, taking aim at Adidas, Drake and more rivals.
After numerous delays, false starts and release dates that came and went, Vultures 2 finally arrived on Saturday (August 3).

On “MY SOUL,” which concludes the album, Yeezy takes a swipe at Adidas, rapping: “We mass targeted, mass marketed, mass incarceration/ Mass in police stations, mass incorporated, fuck Adidas.”
On “530,” Ye seems to take aim at Drizzy, with the line: “You a fake bitch, you don’t really love Ye bitch, go listen to Drake bitch.”

Elsewhere, on “HUSBAND,” Yeezy seemingly takes a dig at his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, who has been mostly single since her and West divorced in 2021.
He raps: “Neighbors know this shit get out of hand, but they smile/ ‘Cause you been so long without a man.”  He makes the message a little clearer, eventually adding: “You know that’s where they at, Beverly Hills/ You know that’s where they at/ I don’t really wanna go back to that/ If I do, I know I’m goin’ back to back/ Breakin’ backs and bags, imagine that.”

This isn’t the first time Kanye has gone after Drake or Adidas.
Back in March, after his Vultures 1 song “Carnival” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, he expressed frustration with various entities.

His collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign, Playboi Carti and Rich The Kid was Kanye’s fifth No. 1 one single, upon reaching the summit, he became the first rapper to top the chart in three different decades.
The controversial rapper and fashion designer used the achievement to take the opportunity to lash out at various perceived enemies.

In a since-deleted post on Instagram, West said: “Rich Ty Carti and the supporters that stood by us through everything This number #1 is for you. It’s for the people who won’t be manipulated by the system.
“And fuck adidas and everybody who works there or with them. Anyone who goes to school with anyone who’s parents work at adidas. Just know they tried to destroy me and here we are with the number 1 song in the world.”

He continued: “Like the fake dude I saw in the lobby at the Ritz that works at Goat You pussys don’t stand for shit. And fuck everybody at the Dailey Mail [sic].
“And Fuck everybody at the fashion houses that sided with Gabby and Hailey Bieber Fuck each and every single one of yall And fuck every so called Christian and so called friend or so called family member that watched me have my kids taken out of my control.”

Kanye ended his message by taking a shot at longtime rival and sometimes friend Drake, who recently recruited West’s “Vultures” collaborator Lil Durk to join him on his It’s All a Blur — Big as the What? Tour.
“That’s how I feel And it’s fuck Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role [sic] out I’ll come back to yall if I think of more fuck you’s,” he concluded.
