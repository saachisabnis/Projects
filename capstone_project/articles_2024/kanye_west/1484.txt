Snoop Dogg continues to expand his multifaceted empire, this time collaborating with his renowned jewelry brand Metal Alchemist and Larry Jackson’s Gamma to launch his very own collection. Reports indicate that Lovechild will make its debut on December 6, available across all Reeds Jewelers stores and online. The rapper expressed in a comment to The Hollywood Reporter, “I chose to name the collection Lovechild because I felt like the world is so full of anger and negativity and division, and I know that I lead with love.” “The news is quick to bring you bad news, so we are stepping in with a whole new force of love.” 
He went on to explain: “Lovechild is a child created from love — while the world is so full of anger, negativity, and division — I’m choosing to lead with love…for the child that still lives within me, for the child that lives within everyone. I wanted to have a product I could share with the world that speaks to every element of who I am at this point in my life.” 
Alchemist explained to the publication that Lovechild represents “Snoop’s unique take on jewelry designed for personal empowerment, well-being, and iconic style that’s rooted in American craftsmanship.” As the year winds down, all eyes are on Snoop’s forthcoming album, Missionary, slated for release on December 13. Produced by Dr. Dre, this highly anticipated project revealed its tracklist on Halloween through an early Apple Music listening. 
The project unfolds across 15 tracks, featuring contributions from longtime partners Eminem and 50 Cent, with standout appearances from Method Man, Jelly Roll, Sting, Tom Petty, Jhené Aiko, and BJ The Chicago Kid. The lineup also showcases rising talents like DMV rapper K.A.A.N., Chicago’s Fat Money—who’s worked on Kanye West’s Donda 2 and Vultures 1—and singer Cocoa Sarai. 
Along with the highly anticipated tracklist, the cover art for Missionary has surfaced, featuring a bold black and gold condom wrapper emblazoned with a promise of “aural pleasure.” This album, a long-awaited follow-up to Snoop Dogg’s iconic Doggystyle, celebrates its 30th anniversary with an all-Dre production, marking the duo’s first complete collaboration since Snoop’s groundbreaking debut.
