Jamie Foxx is a name that’s practically synonymous with talent overload. From Oscar-winning performances (Ray), laugh-out-loud comedy (In Living Color), chart-topping music hits (Blame It), and even hosting (Beat Shazam), Foxx has mastered the art of keeping us guessing. And now, in his Netflix comedy special What Happened Was, he’s back where it all began—making us laugh until our sides hurt.
This isn’t just a comedy special; it’s a Jamie Foxx experience. Equal parts confessional, roast, and masterclass in storytelling, What Happened Was cements Foxx as a comedic heavyweight who refuses to fade into the background. Let’s break down why this special is the talk of the town and why Jamie Foxx still reigns supreme as one of Hollywood’s most magnetic personalities.
Jamie Foxx first burst onto the scene in the 1990s, cutting his teeth in stand-up comedy clubs before skyrocketing to fame on In Living Color. Back then, he was the guy who could outdo anyone with his hilarious impressions and quick wit. In What Happened Was, Foxx taps back into that raw, unfiltered energy that made him a star.
The special serves as a reminder that while Foxx might be celebrated for his dramatic chops, comedy is his foundation. The man isn’t just telling jokes—he’s inviting us into his chaotic, star-studded, and ridiculously funny world.

In What Happened Was, Foxx proves he’s a master storyteller. He doesn’t just tell jokes—he paints vivid pictures. Whether he’s reenacting awkward celebrity encounters or reminiscing about his upbringing in Terrell, Texas, his ability to bring characters to life is unmatched.
One highlight? Foxx’s uncanny knack for celebrity impressions. From spot-on imitations of Denzel Washington to hilariously exaggerated portrayals of Kanye West, his impersonations bring the house down. Foxx isn’t just making fun of people; he’s celebrating the quirks that make them iconic.
Jamie’s been in the industry long enough to have dirt on just about everyone, and he doesn’t hold back. From wild behind-the-scenes anecdotes to sly digs at the absurdity of fame, Foxx lets us peek behind the curtain of Hollywood. He pokes fun at himself too, recounting his own missteps and near-disasters with the kind of self-awareness that makes him so relatable.
While What Happened Was is packed with laughs, Foxx also takes time to reflect on some heavier moments. His near-fatal health scare in 2023 looms large, and Foxx doesn’t shy away from addressing it. In classic Jamie style, he manages to find humor in even the darkest moments, turning pain into punchlines.

Foxx’s charm lies in his authenticity. He’s never lost that “guy-next-door” vibe, even as he became one of the biggest names in Hollywood. In What Happened Was, that relatability is on full display. He’s just a guy with a crazy life and the perfect delivery to tell us about it.
In a sea of Netflix specials, What Happened Was stands out because it feels personal. Jamie Foxx isn’t just performing; he’s hanging out with us. The jokes are sharp, the stories are wild, and the energy is infectious.
But what really sets this special apart is its versatility. Foxx manages to blend sharp observational humor with heartwarming reflections. It’s a comedy special that makes you laugh, think, and appreciate the ridiculousness of life all at once.
