Ye takes Tokyo.
Kanye West enjoyed a solo outing at a Jamaican restaurant in the capital of Japan, two weeks after he was last seen with his wife, Bianca Censori, in the city.
According to a video obtained by TMZ, West, who was dressed in an all-white sweatsuit, stopped by Jamaican restaurant Good Wood Terrace in Tokyo for some jerk chicken.
The Grammy winner reportedly visited the eatery twice in one day and loved the food so much that he signed the restaurant’s wall.
Censori, 29, was notably absent from her husband’s food run. 
In fact, the couple — who tied the knot in December 2022 — haven’t been seen together since last month.
On Sept. 19, the “All of the Lights” rapper and Censori were photographed at a supermarket in Tokyo with two of West’s four kids: Saint, 8, and Psalm, 5.
At the time, the Australian model rocked her signature see-through style, wearing a sheer, nude-colored tank top with cropped gray leggings. 
The following day, the architect and West went on a different shopping spree in the capital city. 
For that outing, Censori rocked a light pink tank with tight, coordinating shorts and black, sock-like shoes from his her beau’s Yeezy brand.
Since then, the “Heartless” emcee has been out without his wife, including on Sept. 30, when West was seen enjoying a Pro Wrestling NOAH event in Tokyo.
It’s unclear where Censori has been over the past few weeks but she is usually by West’s side as he travels throughout the US and internationally.
Her absence comes amid reports that the rapper’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, wants to get a lawyer involved over Censori’s clothing choice around her and West’s kids: North, 11, Saint, Chicago, 6, and Psalm.
