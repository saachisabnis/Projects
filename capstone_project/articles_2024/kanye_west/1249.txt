Sabrina Elba was photographed wearing black strappy sandals at a lunch hosted by Corinthia London in celebration of casting directors following the recently announced inclusion of a “Best Casting” category in the Oscars on Friday. 
The “Best Casting” category, which was celebrated with a luncheon in London, England, is scheduled to officially start being a part of the ceremony at the 2026 awards.
Elba typically chooses dainty footwear when attending major events and occasions. Last month, Elba stepped out to support her husband, Idris Elba, at the Odeon Luxe West End in Christian Louboutin’s white So Kate pumps. The heels featured a sleek leather upper and a pointed toe alongside a 5-inch stiletto heel. In February, she attended the 2024 BAFTA Film Awards in a pair of strappy black, heeled sandals that featured a thin ankle strap and three delicate straps on the front. The entrepreneur was spotted in Louboutin again at the Vogue World: London 2023 catwalk event in silky red Louboutin pumps that boasted a pointed-toe silhouette with stiletto heels of 3.3 inches in height.
