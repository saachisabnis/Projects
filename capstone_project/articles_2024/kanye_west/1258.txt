	“Guys, so, I have a broken calcaneus,” he wrote. “I’m headed to surgery now and there’s gonna be a long recovery time. We have to cancel the tour so I can focus on getting better to be out there in top shape to rage with you all. Theres just no way I can bounce back in time to give 100%. The injury is much more serious than I thought. Anyone who bought tickets will get a full refund, you’ll get an email soon. We will be back with new tour dates as soon as possible, and I can’t wait to get back out there with you guys and turn up how we do. I’m so sorry fam and I love you all so much, thanks for the endless love and support. Im really disappointed as I’m sure you guys are too, but I will be back. Thats a promise. Im ok, just a lil soreness, but I’m in good spirits.”

	The rapper was one of the last-minute additions to the Coachella lineup, and all was going well during his set in the Sahara Tent until he attempted to jump off the stage and got injured. “Hey guys, so I broke my foot today at the show,” he wrote on X shortly after the incident. “Just leavin the hospital. Never broken a bone before so this is all a bit crazy. I wanna thank u all for ur concerns and well wishes!! I love yall man. I heard yall still ragin when I was offstage. Made me smile big.”

	Cudi last appeared at Coachella in 2019, when he performed cuts from “Kids See Ghosts” alongside his collaborative album partner Kanye West. The 43-date Insano world tour was scheduled to kick off on July 28 in Austin, Texas, and featured support from Pusha T, Jaden and Earthgang.
