The Celebrity Beat…
Ye formally known as Kanye West had his chief of staff Milo Yiannopoulos send out a letter to the music industry asking to be referred to as “Ye” moving forward.
The letter states that Ye is one of the most recognizable people in the world, quote, “on par with presidents and popes“.  And that the change was done “fully, legally, and permanently“.
It also mentions that Ye refers to “Kanye” as his slave name.
Quote, “Ye is a black man in America who wants the right to full self-determination just like everyone else.”
Ye’s name has legally been changed since October of 2021.
