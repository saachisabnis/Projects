Kanye West has been an avid collaborator since the beginning of his career, and he has now linked up with a rapper he recently named as one of his favorites in the game right now.
On Tuesday (June 4), Baltimore native Young Moose shared a photograph with Ye inside what appears to be a studio or creative space.

“@ye Thanks For Changing My Life,” he captioned the image. “It’s Up! [earth emoji] Da BIGGEST That Did It!!! [earth emoji] Now Watch This! [side-eye emoji, blushing emoji, goat emoji] #HistoryMade [stacked-books emoji].”

Back in April, the Yeezy boss listed his favorite contemporary rappers during an appearance on Justin Laboy’s The Download podcast.
“It changes, it switches,” he said, before the host mentioned the controversial figure recently telling him that 21 Savage was his top pick.

“Also Kodak [Black],” he responded, after which he took a moment to think. “There’s this new rapper out of Baltimore named [Young] Moose who we’re working with.”
The Chicago superstar then added: “But I told y’all, I don’t even listen to music. I’m too busy getting money! I really, really, really am too busy getting money to listen to too much music.”

A regional sensation, Moose has been making music for almost a decade — his most popular song, “Tru Bill,” has almost four million views on YouTube.
However, his career has also been plagued by drama.
In 2022, he reached a $300,000 settlement with the city of Baltimore after he accused several police officers of illegally obtaining arrest warrants, planting crack cocaine on him during a 2012 search and repeatedly harassing him.

More recently, the 30-year-old was arrested earlier this year for allegedly fleeing a traffic stop and assaulting a sheriff’s deputy.
Kanye naming Moose as one of his current favorites caught many people by surprise on social media, with one user writing: “Kanye shouting out Young Moose is insane! This should put a battery in every Baltimore artists’ back. You never know who’s watching/listening.”

Another person added: “Moose getting a shout out from Kanye was the most random shit ever.”
The MC reacted to the praise himself, taking to Instagram and saying: “This Sh¥t Bigger Than Lyfe ! [battery emoji] Words From ¥esus Himself @ye [goat emoji] #Blessed @justinlaboy.”
