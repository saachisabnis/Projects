The world of sneaker collaborations has seen a resurgence in 2024, with some of the most innovative and exciting partnerships to date. Sneakerheads around the world have been treated to a fusion of high fashion, streetwear, and athletic performance in ways that continue to push the boundaries. Let’s lace up and dive into the best sneaker collaborations that have set the pace for 2024.
Nike x Sacai VaporWaffle Ephemeral Vision
At the top of our list is the Nike x Sacai VaporWaffle ‘Ephemeral Vision,’ a masterful blend of Sacai’s deconstructed aesthetic with Nike’s performance legacy.

Adidas Yeezy Boost 450 Cloud Walker
Adidas and Kanye West continue their partnership with the Yeezy Boost 450 ‘Cloud Walker,’ a design that seems to defy gravity. The shoe features a strikingly organic sole unit that is both futuristic in appearance and exceptional in function — possibly Kanye’s most avant-garde creation for Adidas yet.
PUMA x Rihanna Fenty Trainer ‘Cosmic Gleam’
Rihanna’s Fenty line with PUMA doesn’t stop turning heads with its release of the Fenty Trainer ‘Cosmic Gleam.’ Building on their successful relationship, this sneaker dazzles with its holographic materials that change color under different lighting conditions. Its supportive structure coupled with an edgy design keeps this collaboration at the forefront of fashion-forward footwear.
