SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Controversial rapper Kanye West held a listening party Tuesday at Chase Center.

This wasn't an official concert, but that didn't matter to those who showed up for the event.
"I'm just here to see/ I'm just here for the music, to be honest. I'm not really tripping if he's performing. I've seen the videos. He's just gonna be there, like, walking around without a mic, but I'm just happy to be here to be honest," said attendee Cyrus Graham.
West lost numerous partnerships and sponsorships including a mega deal with Adidas after he made a series of antisemitic statements in 2022.
He did issue an apology in December 2023 on Instagram.
