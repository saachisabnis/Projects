On Saturday (March 30), all those listings were removed from Ye’s Ticketmaster page, with some of the venues he was set to appear at even announcing that they will no longer be hosting the event.
Whereas the PPG Paints Arena (Pittsburgh), Capital One Arena (Washington, DC), Spectrum Center (Charlotte) and Bridgestone Arena (Nashville) have removed the event from their websites, the Amalie Arena in Tampa and Amerant Bank Arena in Fort Lauderdale have shared messages about the cancellation.

“We regret to report that due to the time constraints for Ye and Ty Dolla $ign to curate production and meet logistic requirements, the upcoming dates for the VULTURES 1&2 listening experience will need to be revisited at a later date,” both venues posted.
The Charlotte website Clture reported that a Spectrum Center representative told them the Charlotte show was “officially” no longer happening.

As of now, other venues have yet to confirm the status of the shows, which were originally scheduled to happen in April.
In other news, Kanye West recently added another dimension to the ongoing feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar by entering the race as a third-party candidate.
In late March, the 46-year-old shared his 2016 collaboration with K.Dot, “No More Parties In LA,” on social media, leading many to believe that he was siding with the latter in the aforementioned beef. However, it now turns out that the only team the Chicago native plays for is his own.

Earlier this week, the Yeezy boss shared a since-deleted note on Instagram and took sole credit for a number of notable accomplishments over the past few years, all of which involved collaborating with other creatives.
“EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED KENDRICK ON NO MORE PARTIES IN LA,” he began. “EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED DRAKE AT THE FREE HOOVER CONCERT/ EVERYONE KNOWS I BROUGHT ADIDAS INTO THIS CULTURE AND, I TOOK THEM OUT/ EVERYONE KNOWS LOTTA DEMNA VIRGIL JERRY KIM ALL WORKED FOR ME.”

He continued: “I MADE YEEZUS DARK FANTASY PABLO/ GRADUATION THRONE 808S/ I MADE RUNAWAY DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS FATHER STRETCH/ I AM THE ONLY PERSON TO COME BACK TO NUMBER ONE AFTER CANCELLATION.
“THERE IS ONLY ONE GOAT/ I STAND BY ME/ MY FRIENDS CALL ME YE :)”
