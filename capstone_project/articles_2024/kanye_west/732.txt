The artist formerly known as Kanye West delivered a selection of new YZY SPLY merchandise dubbed the “Gosha,” named after the brand’s new Head of Design, Gosha Rubchinskiy.
The capsule features apparel in the form of a grey hoodie, T-shirt and sweatpants, as well as socks in grey and black. All of the pieces are fronted with the phrase “Black Dog” printed in Russian — paying homage to Rubchinskiy’s Russian roots.
Rubchinskiy was announced as the new Head of Design in late December following his contribution to the artwork of Vultures Volume 1. “YEEZY welcomes Gosha Rubchinskiy as its new Head of Design today. The arrival of this legendary Russian designer at Yeezy, the pre-eminent global brand in music and fashion, is a milestone in design history,” the brand wrote. The designer himself also shared the statement on Instagram that read, “We’re delighted to introduce the new direction of the Gosha Rubchinskiy fashion brand as an independent creative powerhouse. Stepping away from the Comme des Garçons and Rassvet family, our brand is forging its own path. Under Gosha’s creative leadership we are set to embrace exciting new projects and collaborations that embody our spirit of independence and creative drive. We’re thankful for the continuous support from our community that fuels our journey.”
The new merch is available now on YZY for $20 USD each.
