Boosie Badazz doesn‚Äôt agree with Kanye West‚Äôs latest claim.
While speaking to Big Boy in an interview first published on Friday, Ye declared that he ‚Äúinvented every style of music of the past 20 years.‚Äù
"I created Weeknd‚Äôs genre. Trav, Drake, everybody," added Ye, who sat beside his Vultures collaborator, Ty Dolla Sign. "I‚Äômma go ahead and say with all love, Future and Thug also because the auto-tune album, 808s. Everybody thinks about Trav, Weeknd, and Drake but no one thinks about Future and Thug also. The auto-tune album. Now everyone, they added whatever it was to it. But here‚Äôs a new genre. It‚Äôs called making your own money genre. This music is called, like, take that middleman out."
Boosie, 41, became aware of Ye‚Äôs comments on Friday not long after the interview premiered and wrote on Instagram, ‚ÄúNOT ALL GENRES NOT EVERY STYLE üõë NOT BOOSIE MUSIC ‚ÄºÔ∏èüòè YOU CANT RELATE TO NOTHING I RAP ABOUT R YOUR MUSIC‚ÄºÔ∏èNOBODY LISTENS TO KANYE N THE PROJECTS R THE TRENCHES ‚ÄºÔ∏èIM,A GON HEAD N SAY IT ‚Äú MY PEOPLE DO NOT RELATE TO YOU‚Äù
However, Boosie might not be the only industry player that shares those feelings.
Although Kid Cudi didn‚Äôt outwardly deny Ye‚Äôs musical contributions to the genre, he pointed to a screenshot of his own Wikipedia page that stated that his style was influential in creating 808s & Heartbreak.
The Wikipedia entry also highlighted a quote from Kanye taken from Complex‚Äôs 2009 Kid Cudi cover story that acknowledged their joint efforts and pioneering a new musical style.
