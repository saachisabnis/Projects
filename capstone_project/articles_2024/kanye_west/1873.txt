Talib Kweli's hip hop classic "Get By" featured Chinua's voice and allowed him to work with the song's producer Kanye West. In his recent memoir "Vibrate Higher: A Rap Story," Talib says, "Chinua Hawk translated Kanye's high-pitched wail into a run for the ages that my fans love to try and duplicate at the shows."
One of the many highlights of Chinua's career included the time he sang a song with the legendary Celine Dion at Madison Square Gardens in New York City.
"Backing up Celine Dion at Madison Square Gardens was a dream come true. That moment opened my eyes to the reality that anything is possible. I sang with a Legend in a legendary venue that still carries the infectious energy of the great performers that paved the way for artists like myself. I will always have that beautiful memory."
