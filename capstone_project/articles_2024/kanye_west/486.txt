	Khloé Kardashian shared the cutest new video of her kids that proves how close they are to their cousins.

	










	Her daughter True, who turns 6 next month, dances with Kim Kardashian’s 4-year-old son Psalm West and Rob Kardashian’s 7-year-old daughter Dream Kardashian in the cute video on Instagram. The trio are singing along to North West’s “Miss Westie” rap, which was featured on Kanye West’s song “You Don’t Want (North Interlude)” on his upcoming Vultures album.

	The trio know every word to the rap, as they mouth along with North’s part: “I love it here. We’re gonna take over another year. It’s your bestie, Miss, Miss Westie. Don’t try to test me. It’s gonna get messy. It’s gonna get messy. Just, just bless me, bless me. It’s your bestie, Miss, Miss Westie.” These kids clearly listen to North’s rap all the time, and we love how supportive they are of each other!

	The video — which Kardashian captioned “A medley 🤍” — also included clips of True dancing with her brother Tatum, 20 months. Or, more accurately, True dancing while Tatum stares at himself in the camera. (We don’t blame you dude!) Later, True dances along to “Mother” by Meghan Trainor while eating a popsicle, and Kardashian pops in to dance with her daughter as well.

	“the way they know the lyrics supporting their cousin/sister🥹🥹💓,” one person commented. Someone else said, “I see a musical trio in the future!”

	Others commented on how big Psalm looks, like this one person who said, “STOP! When did Psalm get so biggggg 😂😂😂 OMG the cuteness I can’t.”

	Last month, True hosted a “cousin sleepover” with Dream, Chicago (Kim’s 6-year-old), and Stormi (Kylie Jenner’s 6-year-old). The Good American founder shared adorable photos od the cat-themed party, which included cat pillows, snacks, and a screening of The Aristocats.

	In a Sept. 2023 interview with CR Fashion Book, Kim said, “I hope my children will cherish the family community that we’ve tried to instill. For my whole family, we all live close together and the cousins feel like siblings. It’s so special they all have each other.”



	These kids are going to grow up just as close as the Kardashians and Jenners did.
