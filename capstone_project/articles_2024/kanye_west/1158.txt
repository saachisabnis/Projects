Alicia Keys seems to have had one of YTB FATT’s recent hits taken off streaming platforms over sample-clearance issues, and Summer Walker isn’t thrilled about it.
Last month, the Arkansas MC dropped a new single titled “Secrets,” using an unauthorized sample of the singer-songwriter’s 2003 classic “Diary.”

About a month after the track went live, it was removed from all official music services for using the cut without permission, according to Twitter fan account Alicia Keys Daily.
On Monday (March 11), soon after The Neighborhood Talk shared the news of the takedown on Instagram, Summer Walker hopped in the comments section and asked Keys to allow the joint back online with: “Wow that was my new favorite song @aliciakeys put it backkkk.”
In similar news, Kanye West’s dispute with Donna Summer‘s estate over one of his new songs recently turned into a legal matter. According to a report by TMZ in late February, the late singer’s estate is suing Ye because the song “Good (Don’t Die)” from Vultures 1 features vocals that resemble Summer’s hit song “I Feel Love,” the use of which the estate claims to have rejected.
According to court documents, the Yeezy boss tried circumventing their decision by using an interpolation instead of a sample. This, the estate says, still counts as copyright infringement. As a result, Ye, his collaborator Ty Dolla $ign, and the label through which the song was released are all being sued.

After several attempts at having the song removed from streaming platforms, the Queen of Disco’s team is seeking major damages as well as an injunction that would block the track’s distribution moving forward.
“Good (Don’t Die)” was originally taken down from Spotify due to issues surrounding the use of “I Feel Love.” Last week, the track was re-uploaded on the the Swedish streaming platform.

The credits on that version of the song, however, were quite confusing as they listed RichYeRich as the performer, Brian Jamoe as the writer, and no producer. Furthermore, the source was cited as DarkSide LLC, which there are no traces of online.
Since then, the song has once again been removed from all services, though it has already generated millions of streams.
