Kim Kardashian has broken her silence after being dragged in Taylor Swift's new album, The Tortured Poets Department.
The Blank Space songstress appeared to reference the mum-of-four in her 11th studio album track, thanK you aIMee. "There's a bronze spray-tanned statue of you and a plaque underneath it / That threatens to push me down the stairs, at our school," she sings. Taylor once detailed a feud with Kim, saying it "took her down psychologically".
Now the two appear to have reignited their bitter battle, with Taylor also singing: "And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues / And one day, your kid comes home singin' a song that only us two is gonna know is about you." Fans think it's a reference to Kim's eldest daughter North, shared with ex-husband Kanye West, and her new music.

But despite all of this, Kim insists "life is good", finally speaking out in her first interview since Taylor dropped TTPD. She opened up on the latest episode Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday. Host Jimmy joked about Taylor's album in his opening monologue, but didn't appear to ask any pressing questions to Kim herself, sparking comments from viewers.
After chatting about her shapewear brand SKIMS instead, fuming fans said that Jimmy "missed an opportunity" to find out more about Taylor and Kim's dispute. "I'm sure she had her PR people ask him to stay away from those types of questions," wrote another.
Kim and Taylor's feud when Kim jumped to her ex-husband Kanye West's defence after he wrote vulgar lyrics about Taylor. On his 2016 song Famous, Kanye rapped: "I feel like me and Taylor Swift might still have sex. Why? I made that b***h famous."

Taylor wasn't happy with the track, but Kanye claimed to have had an hour-long phone call with her about the lyrics and said she had given her blessing. Kim jumped to her then-husband's defence and shared a video of Kanye's phone call with Taylor. During the chat, he appeared to ask permission to use the lyrics.
Taylor seemed to say: "I know, it's like a compliment, kind of. Yeah, I mean, what's dope about the line is it's very tongue in cheek either way. And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice." However, Taylor insisted that wasn't the full phone call and she was vindicated in 2020 when the unedited version of her and Kanye's call was leaked.
In 2023, Taylor was crowned TIME magazine's Person of the Year and opened up about the impact Kim and Kanye's behaviour had on her. The singer said the long-running feud took her "down psychologically" to a place she had not been before. She explained to the publication: "That took me down psychologically to a place I've never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn't leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didnâ€™t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard," she explained in the tell-all interview.
