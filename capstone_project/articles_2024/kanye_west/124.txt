Political strategist and media personality Van Jones recently criticized Amber Rose for speaking at the Republican National Convention (RNC). Jones believes it’s “the most dangerous speech for the Democratic coalition.” He noted how Rose highlighted the fear of judgment and says it resonated with people.” He points out that because Rose is a woman of color her story will appeal to many. Jones began: “That is a young woman of color. She is describing the experience that a lot of people have — feeling that maybe.”
He continues: if you’re around too many liberals, you might get criticized too much or you might not be able to speak your mind, and she spoke to it really well.” Jones added, “And she’s way more famous than any of us up here — I’m going to tell you that — way more famous. And so to the extent that these guys are trying to bust up our coalition, that was a bunker buster right there.”
Throughout her speech, Amber Rose shared what made her a Trump supporter. While she initially thought he was racist, after doing some research to prove her father wrong, she thought differently. Rose says she then “let go of her fear of judgment.” The former ex of Kanye West realized that “Donald Trump and his supporters don’t care if you’re Black, white, gay, or straight, it’s all love.” 
“And that’s when it hit me: These are my people. This is where I belong.” She continued: “So, I let go of my fear of judgment, of being misunderstood, of getting attacked by the left, and I put the red hat on too,” she added.On July 15, at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, the RNC kicked off its annual conference. The three-day event included various speakers and guests, including Hulk Hogan and Kid Rock.
