	Fans (and haters, we guess) of Drake got 100 gigabytes — yes, 100 GB — of Drake-related data to sift through on Tuesday. The rapper randomly dropped the footage on a website titled “100gigs.org,” which included a video of him revealing that he wanted Future on his biggest hit, “Hotline Bling.”

	A set of videos from the making of the track see Drake doing hookah in the studio while the song is being produced, with Drake listening back to the song, providing commentary, and vibing as it’s being made.

	“It’s melody but it’s a vibe,” he says in one clip that was posted. “When I was writing it, I wrote it as a Shy Glizzy song… That’s why I was asking if we should put Future on this shit.”

	“Me and future on this shit…” he repeats, before someone else in the studio responds, “You gotta wait.”

	Another “Hotline Bling” clip hears Drake explaining the inspiration behind the song’s title and how it was born from a booty call.

	










	“We used to be in bed together. We just finished fucking and her phone would be blowing up, so I saved her name in my phone as ‘Hotline Bling,'” Drake recounted. “That’s always been her name in my phone. Hotline Bling is a sick name, it should be my artist name.”

	“If I was a dancehall artist, I would be Hotline Bling,” he joked in the video.

	On Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, “Hotline Bling” — the radio smash he dropped in 2015 — landed at #373 on the list. The track, from his 2016 LP Views, reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won Grammys for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Performance.

	Along with 3 gigabytes of footage about the song, the website also featured numerous files uploaded in early July and August with different titles such as “Barbados Studio,” “Air Drake,” “Abbey Road,” and “Nonstop in Color.” (Rolling Stone has not gone through all the footage.)

	One 25-minute video sees Drake dive into the process behind Views and shout out Lil Yachty, while another video sees him play ping-pong with Steph Curry. A third video shows Drake recording the reference track for his verse in Kanye West’s “Yikes,” and another clip features Drake and Rihanna rehearsing a live performance of “Take Care” years ago.

	The footage also includes numerous videos of Drake listening to some of his unreleased music, including an extended version of Drake and Future’s “N 2 Deep” and a Certified Lover Boy scrapped song “Piece of Me.”

	Earlier, Drake also shared three new songs that premiered on a mysterious burner Instagram account @plottttwistttttt, along with a link to the website with the footage. The songs — “It’s Up,” “Blue Green Red,” and “Housekeeping Knows” — are the first new releases from Drake since Kendrick Lamar’s chart-topping diss track, “Not Like Us.”
