Bianca Censori only knows how to shop one way ... by looking super sexy.
Kanye West's wife shopped 'til she dropped Tuesday at a Williams Sonoma store in Los Angeles, all while wearing a skin-tight white mini dress and some sheer lace tights to show off her figure.
Bianca's dress barely covered up her butt and she was busting out of her dress ... but we gotta say, this is more fabric than usual as far as BC is concerned. Still, she was showing off her legs and the rest of her assets, as she's known to do.
Must have been a little nippy in the store ... click through the gallery and see what we mean ... pun definitely intended.
Bianca looks to have racked up a pretty big bill here ... because she had a cart full of purchases brought out to her car.
Seeing Bianca at a houseware and kitchen store is super interesting for another reason ... Kanye just bought a $35 million home in Beverly Hills.
