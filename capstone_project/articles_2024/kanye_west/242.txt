The individual who has been accused of stalking Taylor Swift and has been arrested on multiple occasions outside her home will not face criminal trial due to his inability to stand trial, according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.
David Crowe, who has allegedly been lurking around Taylor’s NYC home, has been declared unfit for trial after undergoing a psychological examination. Consequently, the criminal case against Crowe has been dismissed and he will be committed to the custody of the Office of Mental Health to receive the necessary treatment.
Crowe was arraigned last month on charges of stalking and harassment, but he was released and arrested again after returning to Taylor’s block. Following the request from his attorneys for a psychological evaluation, Crowe’s fate is sealed, and he will not face criminal prosecution.
While Taylor was in the city during Crowe’s arrests, she is currently on tour in Japan, preparing to perform at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas, a world away from the ongoing case.
