Kim Kardashian appeared as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday night (April 23) for her first interview since Taylor Swift released The Tortured Poets Department, an album that allegedly features a diss track directed towards the "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" star. 
The entertainment icon sat down with Kimmel to discuss what it was like living next to Madonna as a child, Skims' new "nipple bra" modeled after her own breasts, and more! 
Kimmel introduced a handful of topics and questions but did not get into drama surrounding Swift and Kardashian that resurfaced with the release of Swift's recent album track, "ThanK You AIMee." The capitalized letters in the song's title spell "Kim," and Swifties believe this to elude to apparent beef between Kardashian and the "Cruel Summer" songstress that started back in 2016. 
Per Page Six, Kardashian's now ex-husband Kanye West released "Famous" seven years ago, a single that features lyrics: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b**** famous.” 
Not long after, Swift revealed that she did not give Kanye permission to use those lyrics in his song to which Kardashian insisted that her then husband did receive Swift's approval. The KKW Beauty founder went on to release an alleged "edited" phone call as "proof." Swift later claimed that the phone call in question never occurred. 
In "ThanK You AIMee," released last Friday (April 19), Swift references a “bronze” and “spray-tanned” bully who her mom wishes were dead. While fans continue to speculate about the meaning behind the single, Swift has not officially revealed who the lyrics are about, and Kardashian has not addressed them.
