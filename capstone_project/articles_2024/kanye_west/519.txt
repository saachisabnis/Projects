SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) — Shreveport native and celebrity designer and stylist Latasha Henderson is making waves in the fashion industry.
The Huntington High graduate has styled dozens of celebrities, has been featured on “The Tamron Hall Show” and has competed on Lifetime’s “Project Runway.”
“I’ve worked with Kanye West, Laverne Cox, Telma Hopkins. Anyone you can think of, any type of celebrity you can think of, I’ve done it.”
Henderson competed in Season 15 of “Project Runway.”
“It was surreal for me because I was the first person out of 20 years of this TV show that was from Shreveport, Louisiana. So I put us on the map.”
Henderson has lived all over the world but says cultivating her passion for fashion in her hometown is extra special.
“Shreveport has had my back from the beginning. I’ve been doing this professionally since I was 15 years old. I started off designing sneakers in high school at Huntington. So this literally is my stomping ground.”
Now, the same stylist who broke the Guinness world record for the longest cape will be displaying her award-winning art in the ArkLaTex.
Henderson is hosting a fashion weekend in Shreveport. It begins Dec. 14 with a pop-up shop event with Shreveport area vendors and businesses. It will be held at 624 Texas St. in downtown Shreveport starting at 11 a.m. that date.
“The second day, Dec. 15 ... Jasmine, that is the day,” Henderson said.
The fashion-filled weekend continues Dec. 15 with a fashion show highlighting her new pieces.
“I’m showcasing my new collection. It’s been a while since I did a collection and showcased it here, so this is almost like a homecoming for me.”
