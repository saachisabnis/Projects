The last we heard from Kanye West on the music end, he was preparing for Vultures 2 with Ty Dolla $ign. With the album nowhere in sight, Ye gave Rich the Kid an update on his career.
“I am retiring from professional music,” Ye wrote. “Not sure what else to do.”
Rich responded with a message that echoed the sentiments of many rap fans: “Retire? Why? How? The people NEED you.”
