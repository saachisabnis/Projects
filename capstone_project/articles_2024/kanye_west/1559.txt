Metro Boomin announced that he is releasing, “at the very least,” three albums this 2024.
The artist shared the news on Twitter as an answer to a fan question, who initially responded to Metro’s tweet that read, “2023 was great but just watch what I do 2024!!!!!” Although he didn’t formally reveal which albums will be dropping, fans are speculating that one of them has to be the long-awaited Future collab record; over the holidays, the rapper took to his Instagram Stories with an old tweet that wrote “Pluto x Metro,” along with the added caption “Album on the way.”
Another possible collab album that will drop this year is his joint record with JID, which Metro previously dubbed as “incredible.” Meanwhile, on the solo front, he compared his upcoming Heroes & Villains followup to Kanye West‘s 2010 opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, although he didn’t share any additional info.
