Julia Fox came out as a lesbian after revealing she’s been celibate for over two years. 
On Monday, the actress candidly opened up about her sexuality in response to a TikTok video by user @emgwaciedawgie, who said, “I love when I see a lesbian with their boyfriend. It’s like ‘Aww, you hate that man. You literally hate him.'”
Fox, 34, added her response to the end of the video, saying, “Hey, that was me. I was that lesbian. So sorry, boys. Won’t happen again.” 
Fox received boundless support as fans gushed about how excited they were for her.
“I’m so happy for you,” one person wrote while another added, “This makes my heart so happy.”
The news may not be a shock for some as Fox — who was married to Peter Artemiev from 2018 to 2020 — previously opened up about potentially dating a woman. 
“I have some gay bone [in my body] and I need to explore that a little bit more,” she said during an interview with Ziwe in 2022.
“Like, maybe my ex-boyfriends weren’t wrong when they were calling me a lesbian and complaining that I never wanted to have sex with them.” 
Fox shares shares 3-year-old son Valentino with Artemiev.
After calling it quits with Artemiev, Fox moved on with Kanye West.
She and the controversial rapper dated for less than two months in 2022 amid his divorce from Kim Kardashian.
During an interview with the New York Times in 2023, the Italian American beauty admitted she never had sex with West. 
“It wasn’t really about that,” she shared.
Fox hasn’t publicly stepped out with another romantic partner since West, and has been celibate for over two years.
“2.5 years of celibacy and never been better tbh,” she shared on TikTok in May.
