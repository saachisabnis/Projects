Kanye West is once again making headlines for his alleged involvement in a physical altercation, this time for defending his wife, Bianca Censori, from an unnamed assailant. The incident reportedly occurred on Tuesday night, April 16, and has sparked a battery investigation.
According to TMZ, the altercation occurred after the alleged assailant sexually assaulted Censori. Kanye is said to have punched the man in the face in defense of his wife. While the couple fled the scene after the incident, the man reportedly did not require medical attention.
This isn’t the first time Kanye has been accused of assault or battery. Last year, he was sued by a female photographer who claimed he threw her phone away, leaving her “traumatized and humiliated.” In 2022, West evaded an assault charge after punching a fan outside of a Los Angeles hotel.
In response to the recent incident, a representative for Kanye stated, “‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted.” They described the assailant’s actions as putting his hands under Censori’s dress, grabbing her waist, spinning her around, and blowing her kisses.
At this time, Censori has not filed a sexual assault claim, and it remains unclear if the alleged assailant will face charges for assaulting her. Kanye has yet to comment on the incident, and it’s unknown if it occurred on Disneyland property, where the couple had enjoyed a date night earlier that evening.
