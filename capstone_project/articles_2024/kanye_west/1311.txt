	Between Kendrick Lamar, Drake and even J. Cole, rap fans have been devouring their favorite flavors of beef all month long. But now, pop fans think Taylor Swift is serving up her own heaping helping of piping hot conflict with her old rival, Kim Kardashian.

	With the surprise, 2 a.m. release of The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, a complete, double-album version of the Swift’s long awaited eleventh studio album, fans seem to think that her song “Thank You Aimee” is aimed at the reality star she’s been feuding with since 2016.

	For starters, fans pointed to the strange capitalization of the song’s title across all streaming services. Billed as “thanK you aIMee,” Swifties clocked that the three capitalized letters in the title spell out “KIM.” 

	That trend continued when the Taylor Nation X account tweeted the chorus’ lyrics “Screamed, ‘f–K you aIMee’ to the night sky,” alongside a GIF of Swift performing during the Reputation portion of her Eras Tour set. Not only did fans latch onto the continued spelling of “KIM” through capitalized letters, but they also glommed onto the fact that Reputation was inspired, in part, by Swift’s ongoing feud with Kardashian and her then-husband Ye (formerly known as Kanye West). 

	Fans also pointed to a number of the excoriating lyrics throughout the song, which sees Swift apparently reminiscing on a high-school bully (the titular Aimee) and the impact she had on the pop star’s life. With the opening line, “When I picture my hometown/ There’s a bronze spray-tanned statue of you,” Swifties quickly pointed out the use of the words “spray-tanned,” potentially referencing Kardashian’s famous tan. 

	In the song’s third verse, Swift sings that she “wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool,” and “built a legacy which you can’t undo,” while adding that “there wouldn’t be this, if there hadn’t been you.” Fans theorized that the lyric referenced the infamous leaked phone call and subsequent snake emoji tweet that Kardashian shared in 2016, instances that fans believe deeply influenced Swift’s writing on Reputation. 

	Perhaps the most talked-about lyric on “Thank You Aimee” comes during the bridge, when Swift goes after her bully’s lack of development. “I don’t think you’ve changed much. And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues,” she sings, with fans pointing at the obfuscated name throughout the song’s lyrics. Swifties then pointed to a video of Kardashian and her daughter North West dancing to Swift’s “Shake It Off” as evidence for the bridge’s final lyric: “And one day, your kid comes home singin’/ A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.”

	










	Swift last spoke about her feud with both Kardashian and Ye during her wide-ranging interview as TIME’s Person of the Year in December 2023. “You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” Swift said during the interview. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”
