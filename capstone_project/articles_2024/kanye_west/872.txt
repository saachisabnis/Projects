Bryce actually didn't even know about it until her dad spilled during a talk show appearance.
"The rule was, it's wherever we were conceived. It's so disgusting! For me, it was a city, for my sisters, it was a hotel. My brother, his middle name was Cross after a place we used to live ... That was our road where our house was. My dad would make this joke, "I didn't want to call him back of the Volvo!'" Bryce Dallas Howard shared with ABC News.
9. Nick & Vanessa Lachey
Nick and Vanessa Lachey are the proud parents of three children but it was their daughter, Brooklyn, who was conceived while they were living in New York. While they weren't exactly living in Brooklyn, the couple just wanted to pay tribute to the Big Apple in some way.

"Right after the show my father got down on one knee and he proposed to her for the second time, and exactly nine months later I was born. So I must have been conceived that night after the show or maybe even during the show."
