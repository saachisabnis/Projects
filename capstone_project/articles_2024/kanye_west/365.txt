A 46-year-old Cheyenne man has been sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography - subsequent offense, the United States Attorney's Office announced Tuesday afternoon.
According to court documents, CyberTips received several notifications from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children between August 2023 and December 2023 involving the possession and distribution of child pornography on a Snapchat account and an X account.
Search warrants conducted on those accounts linked them back to Thomas Matthew Ezell, a registered sex offender with two previous convictions involving children and possession of child pornography.
Ezell pleaded guilty on April 24, 2024.
In addition to his 10-year sentence, U.S. Senior District Judge Nancy J. FreudenthalÂ ordered Ezell to pay $9,000 in restitution.
Ezell will be subject to 10 years of supervised release once he's released from prison.
