T-Pain has revealed that there are various other unreleased versions of his classic Kanye West collaboration “Good Life” featuring other artists.
In an interview with Billboard, the rappa turnt sanga delved into the history of the track, which cracked the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and appeared on West’s third album Graduation.

“That song took two months to record. There’s five different versions of the hook and he didn’t use any of them,” T-Pain said. “The version that we know now, I didn’t hear that version of the song until I got to the video shoot.
“It sounded nothing like that in the studio. The sample wasn’t there. John Legend was on it, I think Marsha Ambrosius. So many different versions, so many different artists.”
He added: “Every time he had an idea, I had to go back to work on the song. A very stressful song to make but it turned out great. Once the song got released, I don’t think I was happy because he didn’t use the stuff that was supposed to be hooks. He just kinda pieced together a lot of other stuff I did but it worked.”
Watch T-Pain reflect on the song at the 3:18 mark below.
The Florida native previously claimed that Kanye West stole a line from him after previously dismissing it as corny.
“Kanye stole one of my corny lines,” he said on Twitch in 2021. “I couldn’t believe it. Kanye stole one of my corny lines after he told me it was corny. I don’t think he said it better. I don’t think anything happened that his was better than mine.

“Because mine was out. I was working on Watch The Throne and I was so proud of my new mixtape that I had coming, and it was mostly rap. There was a lot of rap on my shit.
“And I was showing Kanye my shit to be like, ‘Is this good rap?’ I really wanted his fucking opinion. I was dying. It’s fucking Kanye bro, you know what I’m saying? I got a chance to show Kanye my fucking raps?”

He continued: “And he’s not like super hip to my raps. He’s not been a fan of mine long enough to know that I actually rap, too. And I get a chance to show him how I rap. It was either Prevolver — it was one of the Pre mixtapes before I released it.
“And on one of the songs I said, ‘I got beef like two burgers, you n-ggas win slow and I’m smarter than Steve Urkel.’ Now, keep in mind the Winslow family, right? Corny as fuck. I knew it was corny when I said it.”

“Kanye confirmed it,” he said. “He was like, ‘Don’t ever say anything like that.’ Then after that, one of his bars was, ‘Too many Urkels on your team, that’s why your wins low.’ And I was like, ‘Did this n-gga try to get me to not say my shit so he could say it?!’
“I was like, ‘Bro, that’s my bar.’ He looked at me and he was literally bobbing his head, grabbing his chin, and when I said that line he looked at me and said, ‘Don’t say that.’”
