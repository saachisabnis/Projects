The three-minute clip was unexpectedly set to JAY-Z, Kanye West and Frank Ocean’s 2011 Watch the Throne collaboration “No Church in the Wild,” though only Jay and Frank’s vocals can be heard in the trailer.
Directed again by Ridley Scott, the sequel follows Lucius, the fictional grandson of Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris in the original), as he returns to Rome to become a gladiator in the city’s Colosseum.
Lucius is played by Paul Mescal while Washington assumes the role of Macrinus, a Roman powerbroker with a stable of gladiators. Pascal portrays Marcus Acacius, a fearsome general.
Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger also star as the twin emperors of Rome, while Connie Nielsen is the sole returning cast member from the first film.
