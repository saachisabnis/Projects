Lil Nas X has delivered his controversial  single “J Christ” and fans believe the beat is a rip-off of Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE” anthem.
The comeback single arrived on Friday (January 12) and the Gesaffelstein and Omer Fedi co-produced track has an eerily similar baseline to K. Dot’s 2017 banger, which was crafted by Mike WiLL Made-It and Pluss.

“New Lil Nas X kinda sounds like a gay version of Kendrick’s ‘Humble’ haha,” one person wrote while another added: “Meanwhile this is kendrick lamar humble for bottoms.”
In the visual for “J Christ,” Lil Nas X cosplays Jesus Christ on the cross, as well as Moses and Noah. The clip also sees the rapper playing basketball against Satan.

Lil Nas X stirred up conversation on social media even before the release of “J Christ.”
Streamer Kai Cenat went after Lil Nas X for his promo tactics when it came to taunting religion with his new single.

“Yo, Lil Nas X, you could eat my whole dick! I hate that n-gga, bro. God gonna handle you in the right way … God gonna handle you, bro,” he said.
When asked by someone off camera why he’s mad, Cenat added: “He’s extremely disrespectful. Go on his page, bro. He’s disrespecting God himself. He’s disrespecting the whole culture.”

The rapper and singer also recently caught some heat from boxer Ryan Garcia who said on X: “Christian family where are you??? As someone who loves God and is a Christian, I find this one of the most disrespectful and disturbing things someone can do.
“Even if you aren’t Christian this isn’t okay I wouldn’t disrespect someone’s belief and I’m hurt and furious at the same time. More so hurt.”

He added: “Pray for Lil Nas X. Although it may enrage Christians, what he is doing, we are called to pray for our adversaries. So lift him up in prayer so he can see what he is actually doing. Love God with all your heart, mind, and soul. Love one another.”
Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE” is now 7x-platinum and peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and swept Best Rap Song, Best Music Video, and Best Rap Performance at the Grammy Award in 2018.
