Idahoans have a diverse taste in music, and their top drinking songs reflect this variety. For rock enthusiasts, classics like AC/DC's "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" and "Back In Black" are essential to any playlist. If you're in the mood for some rap and hip-hop, Eminem's "Without Me" and Kanye West's "Gold Digger" featuring Jamie Foxx are guaranteed crowd-pleasers.
Pop lovers aren't left out either, with Rihanna's "S&M" and Nelly Furtado's "Promiscuous" making the cut. For those who prefer a touch of country, Morgan Wallen's "Whiskey Glasses" is a must-have. And let's not forget the timeless anthems like "Born In The USA" by Bruce Springsteen and "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones, which always bring people together.
This playlist isn't just about the hits, though. It includes unique tracks that blend into various moods and atmospheres, such as "Feel Good Inc" by Gorillaz and "Sweater Weather" by The Neighbourhood. Whether you're throwing a big bash or just having a casual get-together, these songs will ensure everyone has a great time.
