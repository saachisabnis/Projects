Ye is reportedly in the middle of some legal drama, after allegedly punching a man in the face. He has been named suspect in a battery report, after sources say he assaulted a man that allegedly grabbed his wife, Bianca Censori.
TMZ reports,
A rep for Kanye West says,
“‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted.”
They add, “The assailant didn’t merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.”
