The sweet birthday post came after the Cleveland rapper celebrated his 40th birthday at the Beverly Wilshire on Tuesday (January 30), where Busta Rhymes and the Clipse performed.

Pusha T and Kid Cudi have a long history of working together. Most recently, the pair collaborated on “Rock N Roll” from Pusha’s GRAMMY-nominated album It’s Almost Dry, which came out in April 2022.
The song also features Kanye West, which was a point of contention for Cudi who declared at the time that it would be the last time he appears on a track with the G.O.O.D. Music founder, with whom he had been feuding.

Pusha commented on the pair’s beef at the time, telling Vulture: “It fucking sucks. You know Cudi is my fucking brother to the end. Just navigating these relationships, this brotherhood, the arguing … it gets public.
“It’s one thing for us to argue. We all argue — that’s not a problem. It gets out there, whether it’s Ye bickering first, or Cudi coming back with what he says. It’s super fucked up.”

Cudi is one of several artists expected to appear on the collaborative project (out February 9) alongside Future, Lil Baby, Young Thug and others.

Pusha T, meanwhile, appears to still be at odds with Kanye West after he criticized his former label boss’ antisemitic comments in late 2022.
The Daytona MC later stepped down from his role as president of G.O.O.D. Music and revealed that Kanye was no longer speaking to him.

“It’s beyond that and it’s nothing to tap dance around,” Push said in an interview with XXL. “It’s wrong. Period. But to me, it’s just me and him having a difference of opinion yet again. ’Cause we done had this for years.
“He’s not speaking to me now. If you ain’t with it, you ain’t down. And I ain’t with it. I’m not budging on that. I’m not with it. I heard about this new stuff [about him praising Hitler]. I don’t know. It’s something that just sort of tells me he’s not well, at the same time. I will say that. It’s going to places where it’s no way to move around it.”
