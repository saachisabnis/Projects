The mogul is sharing his thoughts on Drake’s recent beef.
50 Cent says in a new interview, “They said you lost, okay.  Well, what did you lose?  What exactly did he lose, if he got $300 something million on his last tour?”
“You didn’t lose a thing, man.  If that’s the moment, you keep your creative energy in the right place, and keep creating.”
The feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar has affected, not only the hip-hop community, but also the deep personal and professional ties these artists have shared.
