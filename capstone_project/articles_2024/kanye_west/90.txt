In a recent interview, Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson disclosed that he turned down a $3 million offer to perform at former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden. Jackson shared how he was approached to endorse Trump as he campaigns for the White House. “I got a call; they wanted me [for] Sunday,” he explained, referring to the weekend rally.
The rapper revealed that the hefty offer included performing his hit song “Many Men (Wish Death)” at the rally. This was not the first political invite 50 Cent declined; he had also been invited to perform at the Republican National Convention earlier in the summer. “They offered me $3 million,” Jackson stated, indicating the proposal was serious. However, he didn’t entertain it long, as he has a strict stance on avoiding political affiliations.
Explaining his reluctance, Jackson said, “I’m afraid of politics, so you understand? I do not like no part of politics.” For him, stepping into the political arena is risky, given the fierce public opinions it provokes. “When you do get involved, no matter how you feel, someone passionately disagrees with you,” he elaborated. According to 50 Cent, this divisiveness fuels chaos and conflict, which he avoids, even if it means passing up multi-million-dollar offers.
The artist also took the opportunity to clarify his views on sensitive topics. “I steer clear of religion and politics,” he explained, acknowledging these issues often lead to misunderstanding and backlash. Reflecting on the experience of his friend Kanye West, Jackson quipped, “That’s the formula for the confusion that sent Kanye to Japan. He said something about both of those things — and now he can only go to Japan.”
As the interview concluded, the hosts lightheartedly announced that Vice President Kamala Harris was on the line, prompting 50 Cent to jokingly protest, “Why you guys put me into this stuff? I thought we was cool!” The rapper’s humorous response underlined his desire to stay out of politics.
