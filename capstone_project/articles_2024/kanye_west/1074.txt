As Christmas draws near, expectant parents are searching for names that hold both special significance and festive charm for their soon-to-arrive little ones. 
Names such as Carol, Christine and Christian once reigned among December newborns but have seen a decline in favour, replaced by contemporary alternatives.
Striving for a name that is both meaningful and apt for the season can be challenging. Devon Kapler, founder of Go Au Pair, has put forth a list of Christmas-inspired names that embody the holiday's essence—ranging from Bianca to Blaze to Snowden.
"From Bianca to Blaze to Snowden, these names are inspired by the beauty, warmth, and meaning of the season," Devon remarked. "Each one has its own charm, but they're all connected by their ability to reflect the joy and peace of Christmastime."
She added: "These names beautifully reflect the season's themes of light, warmth, purity, and tradition. There's something here for every family celebrating the joy of a winter arrival."
Here are her top picks: 
Blaze
Amongst the top suggestions is 'Blaze', a name that conjures images of bright lights—a key symbol of Christmas.
Devon said: "Blaze evokes the warmth of glowing holiday fires and the radiant spirit of the season," further iterating that "It's a bold and modern choice, full of energy.", reports Wales Online.
Neve
Another favourite, 'Neve', emerges among the selections.
Another name inspired by light is Neve. Originating from the Irish Niamh, meaning "bright," it encapsulates the softer essence of Christmas lights and candles.
"It's a name that shines softly, symbolising the light that pierces the darkness," added Devon.
Blanco and Bianca 
For those attracted to names representing purity and tranquillity, Blanco and Bianca are excellent choices.
Meaning "white" in Spanish and Italian respectively, they symbolise snow, winter's stillness, and the season's serene beauty. Devon noted, "These names also represent brightness and simplicity, perfectly reflecting the peace of Christmastime."
Dove
The theme of purity is echoed in the name Dove, which Devon described as "a symbol of peace, love, and hope, deeply tied to the spirit of the season."
Saint
In a bold nod to the religious significance of Christmas, Saint is rooted in Saint Nicholas, the inspiration for Santa Claus.
"It's a modern, striking name that still carries traditional values of holiness and virtue," said Devon. She mentioned the name had seen a recent rise in popularity due to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West naming their son Saint West.
Wynter
Devon says some names draw directly from the natural elements of winter. Wynter provides a chic, modern twist on the season itself.
"It evokes snowy magic and cosy warmth, making it a stylish and unique choice for a baby born during the holidays," she said. Snowden.
Snowden
Another name fitting this wintry theme is Snowden, evoking visions of pristine snowy landscapes and the tranquil splendour of the season. "It's soft yet strong, a name that's both festive and memorable," noted Devon.
Gabriel or Gabriella
Gabriel or Gabriella serve as sophisticated options for parents drawn to classic Christmas lore. These names pay tribute to the archangel who heralded Jesus' arrival.
"They're steeped in the spiritual significance of the nativity story," Devon elaborated.
Clara
Clara is another elegant choice, echoing the enchanting universe of The Nutcracker, the cherished Christmas ballet. "It's elegant and festive, tied to the magic of the holiday season," Devon commented.
Ivy
Lastly, Ivy brings a dash of perennial charm. Symbolic of Yuletide festoons, it features in the traditional carol "The Holly and the Ivy."
"Its connection to the season's enduring greenery makes it a festive yet timeless choice," Devon remarked, also recognising the contemporary twist Beyoncé and Jay-Z's daughter Blue Ivy Carter adds to the name.
