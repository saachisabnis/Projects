Kim Kardashian revealed her bold new hair transformation during a recent night out in Beverly Hills.
In photos obtained by The Daily Mail, the reality TV personality was photographed out at night as she emerged from a Tesla Cybertruck. Kardashian, 43, was wearing a thin white tank top paired with black leather pants, which had a green stripe running from her hip to her shoes on the outside of each leg.
But fans of the mother of four didn’t take as much note of her outfit as they did of her hair, which has transformed from her signature sleek black color to a wavy platinum blonde. Her dark roots still appeared to be visible at the top of her head.
Despite the dark lighting surrounding Kardashian at the time the photos were taken, her hair color appeared to bring its own light to the images that resulted from the photographers’ flashing cameras, drawing attention to her new ‘do.

Kardashian has recently been fueling rumors of a suspected relationship with Odell Beckham Jr., a wide receiver for the Baltimore Ravens. Some fans believe she confirmed the relationship in a Feb. 11 Instagram post about Super Bowl LVIII. The post featured a photo of Kardashian catching a football and was captioned “game time,” with a football emoji. One fan suggested the photo indicated a “soft launch” for their relationship.
The rumors about the Kardashian-Beckham romance began just over a year after Kardashian’s divorce with Ye (formerly Kanye West) was finalized in late 2022. The two share four children together: North West, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4.
Kardashian’s oldest child with Ye recently celebrated a success tied to her featured role on a song included on the rapper’s new album, Vultures 1. The song, “Talking” charted on the Billboard Hot 100, making North one of the youngest artists to reach that career milestone.
