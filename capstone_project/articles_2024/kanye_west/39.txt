Kanye West’s “Vultures” is producing some weird chart results.
Not a single track has appeared yet on the iTunes top 100 singles. Not one. No one seems to be buying and downloading tracks. 
On the other hand, the album itself is number 2 on the iTunes album chart. And West holds down7 of the top 10 streaming songs.
It’s dismaying to think of people learning the lyrics to his hated filled, vulgar songs. It’s not just the antisemitism. But there is no “clean” version of this rap album, just an explicit one. 
Fatherhood has not dampened West’s coarseness. Can you imagine his four kids with Kim Kardashian in their Rolls Royce SUV, chanting these words during carpool:
Go, go, go, goHead so good, she a honor rollShe ride the dick like a carnivalI done did the impossibleGo, go, go, goHead so good, she a honor roll
How about:
I don’t want your hoesYoung nigga reach all the goalsLet her suck the dick, said she was a proIf she scrape her teeth, I’ma tell her to go
