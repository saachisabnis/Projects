Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori are facing shocking accusations of racism and exposing minors to pornography in a new lawsuit.
According to The Washington Post, Ye is being sued by eight former Yeezy employees who worked on YZYVSN, a streaming service designed to host his upcoming Vultures 2 album with Ty Dolla $ign.

The suit claims that the rap legend, his former chief of staff Milo Yiannopolous and his Yeezy company cultivated a racist environment with brutal working conditions, and failed to pay several members of staff despite promising to do so.
The former employees claim they were also subjected to racist, sexist and homophobic treatment while communicating remotely on platforms like Discord, including being referred to as “slaves” and “new slaves,” the latter being the name of Kanye’s Yeezus song.

The complaint also says that racial slurs were made against Black team members and only white team members were promised developer positions at Yeezy.
The plaintiffs, some of whom are minors as young as 14, also claim they were exposed to pornographic content by Bianca Censori, who allegedly sent one employee a file-sharing link containing hardcore sexual activity.

Kanye announced earlier this year that he was launching his own Yeezy Porn brand, although he appears to have since pulled the plug on the project.
Censori is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
“No guardrails were put in place to prevent the underage YZYVSN workers from working on Yeezy Porn, or to prevent them from being exposed to and being forced to view pornography to perform their work,” the suit reads.
The plaintiffs are seeking payment for unpaid wages along with attorney fees, as well as damages for emotional distress.

Kanye West has yet to comment on the lawsuit, but Yiannopolous denied the allegations on X (formerly Twitter).
“A joke lawsuit just dropped led by a disgruntled, comically inept Black developer I call Hotep Susan who is mad he didn’t get chosen for a full-time Yeezy job,” wrote the controversial alt-right figure, who recently left the company.

“My question: Why did he need one, given his record of FAKING job history (including Yeezy roles he never held)? I’ll eviscerate the complaint line by line tomorrow on camera, including his bonkers racism claims.
“Truly, it’s the most dishonest thing I’ve ever seen filed with a court. (And I’ve worked for billionaires and megastars for a decade.) He has no standing and doesn’t represent either of the acquired apps. Just wait until you read it. Another sad race hustle. It’s a No from me, Susan, as in Not. One. Dime.”

Addressing the porn allegations, he added: “The company has signed releases from and contractor agreements with every contributor to every closed and every open source project, including parents or guardians where appropriate. Yeezy Porn doesn’t exist, so could not have been shown to anyone. Clowns.”
This is just one of several lawsuits from former employees that Kanye West is currently fighting.

Last month, the G.O.O.D. Music founder was sued by a former assistant who claims he sexually harassed her and once masturbated in front of her on a plane.
The ex-assistant, a former OnlyFans model called Lauren Pisciotta, also says that West would send her photos and videos of himself having sex and was “fixated on the penis size” of her boyfriends.
