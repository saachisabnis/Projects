A legal storm is brewing at two of its most prestigious educational institutions, Columbia University and Barnard College, where groups of Jewish students claim they are being subjected to racism. 
A lawsuit filed by Students Against Antisemitism, Inc., alongside Jewish and Israeli students and the StandWithUs Center for Legal Justice, alleges a pattern of antisemitism on campus, challenging the institutions’ commitment to inclusivity and safety for all students.
The suit alleges that these institutions have systematically allowed a hostile environment of antisemitism to proliferate on their campuses, severely impacting the well-being and academic experience of Jewish and Israeli students.
The complaint delineates a series of troubling events and practices at Columbia University and Barnard College that illustrate the severity of the antisemitic climate. 
Rap star Kanye West was blamed for helping to create a dangerous climate on the campus. In one incident, students openly discussed the antisemitic conspiracy theories Kanye West has spewed and circulated an image of a s####### in a campus dining hall. 
Additionally, the lawsuit recounts an episode where a student encountered three student-athletes using the phrase “Jew someone down” as a derogatory term, further illustrating the casual antisemitism that permeates the campus environment.
The lawsuit claims faculty and students have openly praised the violent actions of Hamas, referring to them as “astounding” and “awesome,” in a clear display of support for acts of violence and terrorism. 
Furthermore, the campuses have witnessed marches where hundreds of pro-Hamas students and faculty chanted deeply antisemitic slogans, calling for violence against Jews and promoting genocide. 
These actions have not only been allowed to occur but have gone largely unaddressed by the university administration, contributing to an atmosphere of fear and exclusion for Jewish and Israeli students.
The lawsuit accuses the institutions of not enforcing their policies against discrimination, failing to condemn acts of antisemitism effectively, and neglecting to take disciplinary action against those who engage in such behavior. 
This, according to the complaint, has allowed a culture of antisemitism to thrive, significantly hindering Jewish and Israeli students’ ability to participate fully in campus life.
The students are seeking a range of remedies from Columbia University and Barnard College, including the implementation of comprehensive measures to combat antisemitism on campus, disciplinary action against those who perpetuate antisemitic acts, and the development of educational programs aimed at raising awareness about antisemitism. 
Additionally, the lawsuit calls for the universities to ensure the safety and inclusion of Jewish and Israeli students by enforcing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and to provide compensation for the harm caused by the hostile environment.
