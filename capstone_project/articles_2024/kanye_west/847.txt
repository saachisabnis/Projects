Charlamagne Tha God has put his own [loose] expiration date on his time at The Breakfast Club, as he has a bigger picture in mind.
The famed personality has served as co-host of the popular New York City-based morning show on Power 105.1 since 2010 alongside DJ Envy, and until 2022, Angela Yee. Yee has since been succeeded by Jess Hilarious.

During a recent appearance on the Flagrant podcast, Charla was asked when he plans to leave the show.
“I personally have a number,” he replied around the 2:15:54 mark. “Not even Breakfast Club, but just being a talent period. Not a financial number.”

He won’t be totally gone from the industry, though.
“I like being behind the scenes a lot more nowadays. Empowering other people, watching people get their shit off, watching other people become these great entities that people love and fuck with.”
Known for his controversial takes, Charlamagne Tha God also spoke on Kanye West during his Flagrant appearance and slammed him for attempting to insert himself into the feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
He also called him musically irrelevant.

“Nobody cares about Kanye rapping,” he said. “If Kanye had done this 10 years ago, it’s like, ‘Ooh shit, Kanye inserted himself in the beef!’
“Nobody gives a fuck about Kanye rapping in 2024. Especially when the guys that are rapping are the rappers you actually want to hear from.”

Despite Charlamagne’s comments, Kanye scored his first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 in over a decade earlier this year with “Carnival,” from his joint album with Ty Dolla $ignVultures 1.
It marked his first chart-topper as a lead artist since 2007 when he reached the summit with “Stronger,” which has since been certified diamond.
