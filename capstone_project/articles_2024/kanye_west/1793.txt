Kanye West has clapped back at people who have been criticizing him for frequently posting half-naked pictures of his wife, Bianca Censori.
In a clip posted to Instagram on Monday (February 12), Ye issued a PSA while walking next to his wife in an airport.
“Y’all, I just wanna tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose,” he laughed as he panned the smartphone camera to Bianca, who could be seen laughing next to him. “You understand what I’m saying? So what I’m saying is – I delivered the album, then people still in my comments talking about, ‘Why you post your wife?’ ‘Cause she make me happy. That’s why y’all happy with the music – ’cause I’m happy. You understand?”

He continued: “So don’t never say nothing negative. If you don’t like my page and don’t like what I’m posting, go fuck yourself! Seriously. Leave me— leave the king the fuck alone. I don’t care, bro. I’ma post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your fucking Instagram.”
In his caption, he added: “Ima post my wife as much as I want bro. It makes me happy. Some people don’t want you to be happy. They want you to make them happy. I decided to make myself happy and I’m happy with that.”
Last month, Kanye had an explosive interaction with a member of the paparazzi after he was asked whether Bianca has “free will.”
The incident occurred in Los Angeles in late January as the Yeezy boss was en route to Charlie Wilson’s Walk of Fame ceremony. Footage of the incident showed a TMZ photographer asking him: “People want to know if Bianca has her free will? People are saying you are controlling her.”

In response, Kanye grabbed the woman’s phone and replied: “I don’t give a fuck. Don’t come ask me some dumb-ass shit. I’m a person, bro! Don’t come ask me that dumb-ass shit. You got kids? Exactly. So what do you do? Who do you work for? Why do you feel like it’s okay?”
He continued: “I’m a human being. TMZ, y’all set celebrities up. All this bullshit. I don’t care what y’all gonna do, what y’all got to say. Don’t come at me with that shit. Walk up on me like that. What you think ’cause you a White woman you can walk up on me like that?”

Initially, he refused to give her phone back and even taunted her, though he eventually returned it.
Concern over the nature of Kanye and Bianca’s relationship heightened earlier that month after a series of snaps posted to Ye’s Instagram showed her in various states of undress, from wearing what a tight leather bodysuit to practically nothing at all.
Fans couldn’t help but question the true dynamic of their relationship, with many taking to the comments section to voice their displeasure.

“Why do you exploit this poor woman? Shame on you. You need therapy sir,” one person replied, while another pointed to Kim Kardashian as an example of how hypocritical he really is and wrote: “I remember the episode where he was telling Kim he didn’t want her to expose herself so much. FFWD to this. Poor girl being degraded on the daily. I hope she believes in herself to realize she is much more than this.”
