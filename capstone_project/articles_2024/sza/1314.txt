Victoria Monét has released a holiday edition of her album Jaguar. A Jaguar II Christmas: The Orchestral Arrangements features orchestral versions of her album cuts, which intertwine some holiday classics. Songs like “Smoke” and “Hollywood,” for example, are blended with Christmas staples “Let It Snow” and “Carol of the Bells.” “I hope this fills you and your family with much needed holiday cheer and the Christmas spirit,” Victoria wrote on Instagram when announcing the album.
