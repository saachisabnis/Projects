Organizers of the Sudden Little Thrills festival have called off the inaugural event less than a month after announcing its lineup. The two-day music festival was supposed to take place at Pittsburgh’s Hazelwood Green September 7 – 8. 
“We were excited to bring a new world-class music festival to Pittsburgh, however, due to circumstances beyond our control, the Sudden Little Thrills festival will not take place in 2024,” noted a message posted on the festival’s website. “Tickets purchased directly through Front Gate Tickets will be automatically refunded in as little at 30 days to the original method of payment.”
Pittsburgh’s own Wiz Khalifa was slated to headline the inaugural Sudden Little Thrills along with SZA and The Killers. The event’s eclectic lineup also featured Girl Talk, St. Vincent, Omar Apollo, FLETCHER, Yung Gravy and more. 
All posts have been wiped from Sudden Little Thrills’ Instagram, Facebook and X accounts on Tuesday. As noted, refunds will be issued automatically via Front Gate Tickets.
