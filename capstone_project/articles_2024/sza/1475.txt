SZA originally snuck a teaser of the new song, “Saturn”, into a MasterCard advert during the 2024 Grammys broadcast. 
Now she has officially released the track alongside two different versions – one sped up version and a live rendition. The track comes as the lead single for the forthcoming album, LANA, which is a deluxe edition of her second studio album, SOS.
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, SZA shared that she doesn't want to do herself a disservice by speaking too much about LANA before its completion because it can shift the energy and direction that it would normally naturally go into. "You got to let it form itself. Because I’m not really forming anything. I’m just kind of here while energy is forming and I’m just trying to allow it to do what it needs to do, and my voice just follows whatever the frequency is," she explains. 
"Saturn" is out now.
