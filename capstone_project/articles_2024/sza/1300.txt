Kesha took the stage during Lollapalooza at Grant Park on Aug. 01 in Chicago. 
The “Die Young” singer kept it casual in a pair of Chuck Taylor All-Star Converse in black and white. The beloved silhouette featured contrasting black and white canvas uppers along with white rubber toe accents, flexible non-slip rubber soles, silver eyelets fixed to the facade and matching white lace-up closures. Beyond Kesha, Converse styles are a go-to sneaker for many stars including Timothee Chalamet, Charli XCX, Mila Kunis, Paris Jackson, John Hamm and Madison Beer, just to name a few. 

 









Converse’s black and white canvas sneaker, low-top or otherwise, is by far one of their most classic silhouettes, toting longevity and style since its debut back in 1949. The All-Star style was then introduced in a low-cut “Oxford” inspired style in 1957. After all these years, the canvas style still holds true, becoming a closet staple for many.
