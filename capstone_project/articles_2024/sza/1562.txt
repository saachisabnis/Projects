McOsker paid tribute to Top Dawg’s success on Instagram, writing: “Today in Council Chambers we honored Anthony ‘Top Dawg’ Tiffith, founder of Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). This neighborhood record label would soon go on to be home to Grammy award winners and a Pulitzer Prize winner for literary excellence.
“As the founder of TDE, Top Dawg has had a transformative impact on our beloved community of Watts. Raised in the Nickerson Gardens housing development, his commitment to uplifting local talent and fostering a sense of pride within our beloved Watts has been a beacon of hope.”

He added: “Top Dawg is a great example of somebody who comes from community and has created for himself an opportunity to become such a significant figure beyond the limits of our beloved Watts — but doesn’t forget where he comes from. And he does that by making sure he’s in Watts, uplifting folks.”
McOsker also shared pictures with Top Dawg as the street was renamed after the record executive.
He added: “Starting today, whenever you drive through Central Ave. at Imperial Hwy. – either entering or exiting Watts – you’ll be passing through Anthony Tiffith ‘Top Dawg’ Square.
“You can look up and be reminded of a great man from Nickerson Gardens, the founder of Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), who is still leaving his mark on the world, but never forgot his roots and continues to give back.

“From holiday concerts and gift drives, to free Black Panther showings for Watts kids, to helping folks make their rent payments during the pandemic — Top Dawg impact cannot be understated. It was so powerful to be with his family, friends, and TDE today to recognize and appreciate a man who has uplifted so many.”
Jay Rock, who has been signed to TDE since 2005, also celebrated his label boss, commenting: “I mean he put me in the studio and gave me an opportunity. He not only did that for me, but you know, he took me like his own and raised me up to be a better man that I am today.
