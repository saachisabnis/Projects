The 1963 Japanese crime film was based on the Ed McBain novel King’s Ransom, which tells the story of a businessman’s ruin following a ransom payment to kidnappers.
A lot of fans had been speculating that something was brewing between Ice Spice and Spike Lee back in February, when the pair met up in Brooklyn and shared the moment on social media. However, there were tons of jokes about the meeting as well.

In response to the veteran director captioning the post, “Yesterday Da Boogie Down Bronx made a visit to Brooklyn,” one person wrote: “now Spike [laughing face emojis].”
Taking the comment in a way it didn’t seem to be intended, the filmmaker replied back: “Git Ya Mind Outta Da Gutter [surprised face emoji].”
“It’s not,” the fan replied. “It’s just a pairing I wasn’t expecting.”

Spice simply captioned the slideshow, “alright,” while her British counterpart shared one of the pictures on his own Instagram page along with the message: “Lord forgive me as I’m a sinner.”
