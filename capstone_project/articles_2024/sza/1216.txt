THE KILLERS WERE ONE OF THE FESTIVAL’S SCHEDULED HEADLINERS | PHOTO: SHUTTERSTOCK
The organizers of the Sudden Little Thrills festival today announced that the inaugural concert, originally scheduled for Sept. 7-8, will not take place.


A statement posted to the festival’s website contained the abrupt announcement: “We were excited to bring a new world-class music festival to Pittsburgh, however, due to circumstances beyond our control, the Sudden Little Thrills Festival will not take place in 2024. Tickets purchased directly through Front Gate Tickets will be automatically refunded in as little at 30 days to the original method of payment.” (It was not immediately clear if the phrase “at 30 days” was a typo or a projected date of refund.)


The festival, which was set to feature headliners including The Killers and SZA and take place on Hazelwood Green, was announced with some fanfare earlier this year; the lineup was revealed mere weeks ago. Billboards throughout the region advertised the festival.


No explanation was given beyond the statement on the Sudden Little Thrills website, and social-media accounts for the festival were scrubbed of content. A publicist representing the event told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that no further comment on the cancellation would be forthcoming.


Another regional music festival, the Wonderworks Music Festival, previously announced it would not return for 2024 after two events at Hartwood Acres.
