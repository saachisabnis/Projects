Tinashe has jokingly dubbed Drake‘s “Rich Baby Daddy” her theme song of 2024 as she hopes to manifest exactly what the title suggests.

“My theme song for 2024 is ‘Rich Baby Daddy’ by Drake because I’m manifesting for myself a rich baby daddy!” Tinashe said.

Not everyone is as big a fan of the Drake song like Tinashe – as Dee-1 recently spoke out against the record after seeing a viral video of a group of young girls dancing to it.
“This ain’t cool, man,” he said of the performance, which has drawn both praise and criticism. “And this ain’t cute. But the real question is, what are we going to do about it? It takes artists to make the music, it takes fans to support the music, and it takes adults to figure out what they’re going to expose their kids to. Right?”

He continued: “So first off, as fans, you gotta make sure you’re not supporting this, and you’re not promoting this type of music. Matter of fact, you really need to be vocal that you’re opposed to this, if you really have a problem with it.”
“As artists, we just gotta decide when we wanna stop being manipulated, man,” he concluded. “And letting them use us as pawns.”
