SZA is set to be honored with the Hal David Starlight Award at the 2024 Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction and Awards dinner.
At the event, which is going down on June 13 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City, the SOS singer will become the second Black woman to receive the honor, following Alicia Keys in 2005.

The award is presented to “gifted young songwriters who are making a significant impact in the music industry with their original songs,” according to a press release.
In a statement, SHOF chairman Nile Rodgers said: “This is such an exciting time for songwriters and music. Phenomenal artists like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift are pushing the envelope of what success looks like, but who could argue that the last two years belong to SZA. Incredible songwriting, incredible performances, incredible artistry. She so deserves to be the 2024 recipient of the Hal David Starlight Award!”

Reacting to the news on her Instagram Story, SZA said, “This is THE most meaningful thing to me you have NO idea. THANK YOU beyond words for seeing me at all.”
The chart-topping, record-breaking SOS album was released in December 2022, and a deluxe edition titled Lana has been in the works for some time since. However, fans will have to wait even longer, as SZA recently revealed that she will be remaking the effort from scratch after fans have leaked a number of songs slated for it.
In since-deleted Tweets in March, the “Snooze” singer expressed frustration at the songs hitting the web.

She wrote: “So, we’ll make this really simple. Y’all leaked three songs from the deluxe. At this point, y’all can keep the throwaways and leaks. I’ll be starting ‘Lana’ from scratch. Do not ask me about it again. Thank you.”
In a second post, she added: “I’ll round up the leaks y’all already got and u can have those. Seems like a fair deal. ENJOY.”

SZA has been teasing an expansion of her blockbuster sophomore album for a while.
Late last year, she posted a number of potential covers for the deluxe version, and suggested the project would drop before Christmas, but it never did.

She also spoke about the release with Billboard, saying: “After I do the deluxe, I’m hoping to be able to accept that this chapter is done. I’m looking forward to actually feeling proud of myself and not just smiling and nodding at accolades but really feeling it internally and knowing that I’m good enough.”
She added: “I guess I need to stop trying to figure out what it means and start realizing and living in what it is.”
