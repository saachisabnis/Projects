There are a lot of things we look forward to every year, and something that is most definitely in our “Ins” column for 2024 is celebrity pregnancy announcements. Whether they do it with a whisper or a bang, we are always excited when we hear that one of our favorite stars is expecting a little bundle of joy. And then, if they take us along their pregnancy journey — sharing bumpdates and babymoons and baby showers — all the better!
Last year, we saw some epic pregnancy announcements. Of course, Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show announcement was amazing. Kourtney Kardashian recreating the “All The Small Things” music video at a Blink-182 concert to announce that she was expecting a baby with husband Travis Barker was iconic. And Olympic gold medalist Shawn Johnson announced that she was expecting Baby No. 3 with husband Andrew East in the most perfect location: At the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in front of the Olympic rings.
All that said, we do love a good surprise too! We were floored in 2023 when celebrities like Paris Hilton, Ashley Olsen, and Chrissy Teigen shocked the world with unexpected birth announcements, having given no signal that a baby was on the way. And yes, Hilton and Teigen both did it twice in one year.
Just a few days into 2024, we’ve already seen some super sweet pregnancy announcements from the likes of actress Rose McGiver (at the Golden Globes), country music singer Jon Pardi, and HGTV star Drew Scott. And now we can’t wait for all the announcements to come! Below, we’ve listed every famous figure who announced in 2024 that they’re expecting a new addition to their family. Congratulations!

“We had a plan [to start trying in early 2025]. This was a little bit earlier than our plan. But we figured this baby needed to come at a certain time,” Sanchez said.
The parents — who also share a son Asher and twins Isabelle and Zariah — will now be part of the Four Under 4 Club, and Booko joked that they should keep going: “I think we’re just gonna go for a football team.”

A strange feeling of incompleteness by not having that level of love and responsibility in my journey. That the best years of my life would be on the other side of finally being a father. But deep down I knew that there were things in my life that needed to shift before I was ready for the blessing of something so special and the responsibilities that come with it.”

I think the narrative needs to be shifted a little bit.”

“In another world I could have waited to take a test another day, but for whatever reason I was like, ‘I’m past a week being late, and I should just take the test,’ ” she told PEOPLE. “And then it was just like, ‘Oh my gosh. We play this huge show tonight, and now I’m holding in this huge secret.’ ”

Sofia Richie first had an inkling she was expecting a baby with husband Elliott Grainge in the chicest setting.
“I found out very, very early,” she tells Vogue in her pregnancy announcement. “I was about four weeks pregnant. I was on a trip to Milan for fashion week, and I was going to the Prada show…I felt terrible but didn’t think much of it. I thought it was jet lag.”
She told the outlet she and her husband had been casually trying to get pregnant for months so he “didn’t really flinch” when she decided to take a test before having a “boozy night” at the Ed Sheeran concert. The faintest of lines appeared on her “really crappy at-home test,” so she sent Grainge to CVS to pick up three of the best tests he could find.
“We spoke the whole way on the phone,” the model said. “And when he came home, he’s such a sweet guy he always wants to protect my emotions and expectations, so he kind of sat me down and said, ‘If these are negative, don’t be upset. Our moment will come.’ When we turned over all three tests at the same time they were all positive. He was so excited, and we both cried. It was crazy and overwhelming and so hard not to scream it from the rooftops. But knowing I was so early, I was so protective—even with my friends.”
When she reached the 8-week mark, the couple decided to tell their parents. They gave them “a Hermès box or some sort of box” and said there was a gift inside from Milan Fashion Week.
“Everyone was like ‘Ooooh Hermes!’ But then they opened it and it had all three of the pregnancy tests [in it]. That’s how we told all of our parents. Watching their reaction go from like, ‘I’m about to get an expensive present’ to like ‘I’m about to get a grandchild’ was really sweet.”

Too Hot to Handle alums Emily Miller and Cam Holmes are expecting a baby, per People, a year and a half after the couple tragically suffered a pregnancy loss. At the time, Miller was hospitalized for an ectopic pregnancy and had to have a fallopian tube removed.
“After what happened last time, I didn’t even know if I’d even want to get pregnant again in case I had to go through that again,” Miller told the outlet. “It sounds cliché, but it really is our little miracle. This is what I’m so excited for, to be able to tell people it is possible.”
Miller sweetly relayed that her mom was the first person she told, given that she is living with her mom and Holmes is living with a friend while they wait to move into a new home.
“As soon as I took the pregnancy test, I came out of the bathroom, and she was literally walking past my room, and so I said, ‘Oh my God, Mum,'” Miller said. “We were both just hugging each other in tears. She’s been so good. If I come through the door even holding a shopping bag from the supermarket, she’ll be like, ‘No, no, no, no, no. Let me take that. Let me take that.'”
Holmes did not have quite the same reaction at first. “I wish I recorded his reaction because it looked like someone had seen a ghost,” Miller said. “I’ll say it wasn’t the reaction I was hoping for, but he’s more of a realist. I think, because of what happened last time, he was just very skeptical, and he was just worried, I think, is what it came down to. He was just like, ‘But what if it happens again?'”
Since then, he’s gotten so excited, Miller shared, and the two can’t wait for their “miracle” baby who is due in June 2024.
