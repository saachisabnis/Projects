Travis Scott has overtaken Kendrick Lamar to have the highest-grossing solo Hip Hop tour of all time.

While Scott has the biggest solo rap tour, he’s still some way behind Drake, J. Cole and 21 Savage, whose co-headlining It’s All A Blur Tour grossed an enormous $320 million.
It has been a boom period of late for Hip Hop tours, with 50 Cent and Nicki Minaj also embarking on international runs that have generated over $100 million each.

Nicki’s Pink Friday 2 Tour, in particular, made history as she became the first female rapper to gross more than $100 million from a single tour.
She also became just the fifth Black woman to surpass the mark following Beyoncé, Rihanna, SZA and Tina Turner.

Meanwhile, Travis Scott’s Circus Maximus Tour was his first global trek in five years following his Astroworld – Wish You Were Here Tour.
That tour, which was comprised of 57 shows, grossed over $63 million, meaning the Cactus Jack rapper has more than tripled his taking on his latest run of shows, despite only playing 21 more gigs.
