Rap beefs are an integral part of the fabric of hip-hop and when it comes to Drake and Kendrick Lamar, their newly-sparked feud dates well back to 2013.
The 37-year-old Canadian and the 36-year-old Compton native started out amicable collaborating on Drake's 2011 album Take Care, Kendrick's 2012 track Poetic Justice, and A$AP Rocky's 2013 track F***** Problems.
The rap rivals even happily toured together in 2012 during Drake's $42.6M-grossing, 65-date Club Paradise Tour.
But Lamar (born Duckworth) drew a line in the sand in 2013 with his song Control: 'I'm usually homeboys with the same n****s I'm rhyming with / But this is hip-hop and them n****s should know what time it is / And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale, Pusha T, Meek Millz, ASAP Rocky, Drake. 
'Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller / I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you n****s / Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you n****s / They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you n****s.'

That same year, the Pulitzer Prize-winning musician referred to tucking 'a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes' at the BET Awards yet told Complex things were 'pretty cool' with Drake (born Aubrey Graham), but added: 'I mean, I would be okay if we weren't.'
In 2014, the OVO Sound co-founder gave a shout out to Kendrick during his OVO Fest set, calling him a 'king' and 'one of the hardest n****s alive.'
The feud went dormant until last Halloween when Drake and J. Cole released their song First Person Shooter referring to themselves and Lamar as 'the big three': 'Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K. Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me? / We the big three, like we started a league.'
The 17-time Grammy winner apparently had a big problem with that, which he expressed in an uncredited verse on Metro Boomin and Future's track Like That, which dropped on March 26.
'Sneak dissin' / First Person Shooter / I hope they came with three switches,' Kendrick rapped.
'I still got PTSD / Muthaf*** the big three, n***a, it's just big me.'
Lamar also said 'Prince outlived Mike Jack' as a shot to the five-time Grammy winner, and he rapped of his album For All the Dogs: 'N***a, bum, before all your dogs getting buried / That's a K with all these nines, he gone see Pet Sematary.'
On April 4, J. Cole released a response track titled 7 Minute Drill in which he called Mr. Morale 'attention seeking' and that he 'fell off like The Simpsons.'

Three days later, the German-born 39-year-old expressed regret while onstage his Dreamville Music Festival in North Carolina, calling the since-deleted track the 'lamest s*** I did in my f***ing life.'
On Saturday, a four-minute 'leaked' track titled Push Ups (credited to Drake) surfaced on multiple X (formerly Twitter) accounts which blasted Kendrick, J. Cole, The Weeknd, Rick Ross, Metro Boomin, and Future.
'How the f*** you "big" stepping with a size 7 mens on?' the biracial hip-hop star rapped, referring to Lamar's 5ft5in stature.
'Your last one bricked, you really not on s*** / They make excuses for you because they hate to see me lit / Pull your contract because we gotta see the split / Ain't no way you doing splits b**** your pants might rip.'
Drake's 'split' was referencing the Emmy winner's recording contract with Top Dawg Entertainment, which allegedly demands 50 percent.
'Top say drop, you better drop and give him 50 / Pipsqueak, pipe down,' the Rich Baby Daddy star rapped.
'You ain't in no big three, SZA got you wiped down, Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down / Like your label boy, you Interscope right now.'
Drake also dragged Kendrick for being in Taylor Swift's Bad Blood squad: 'Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties.'
The 17-time Grammy winner also said 'Prince outlived Mike Jack' as a shot to the five-time Grammy winner, and he rapped of his album For All the Dogs: 'N***a, bum, before all your dogs getting buried / That's a K with all these nines, he gone see Pet Sematary'

Randomly, Uma Thurman inserted herself into the feud on Sunday by Instastorying a snap of her Kill Bill 2 costume (originally inspired by Bruce Lee's costume in Game of Death) with the caption: 'Need this? @champagnepapi?'
Two hours later, Drake replied by referring to the fictional swordsmith from her films: 'Yes pls. The pen is the Hattori Hanzo'
The Titles Ruin Everything poet rapped of J. Cole: 'As for his I don't care what Cole think, that Dot s*** was weak as f***.'
