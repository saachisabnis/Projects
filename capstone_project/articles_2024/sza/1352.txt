Towards the end of the interview, around the 20:48 mark, the “Snooze” singer was asked what she has going on in her life.
She said: “I’m going through a break-up, it’s hot as fuck, and these [pointing to the hot sauces] were enjoyable and I’m excited for my album.”
SZA’s decision to rock a bug prosthetic caused quite the stir and led fans to speculate behind its meaning.
During the interview she was asked about “the value of disguise.” Regarding the bug mask, she began: “This one brings me so much peace of mind.”

She added: “In the realm of like, being a person is so daunting, and like, being in your own skin and the whole Sheboygan, and like, the freedom of, yeah, for no other reason that I’m just tired of being…not a bug. It’s like, what the fuck? Wouldn’t you want to be a bug if you could be anything else?”
Earlier this year, SZA posted photos of herself in a full bug costume to Instagram, leading some fans to speculate that the reemergence of the costume has to do with her Lana deluxe project. Check out the photos here, as well a clip she teased, below.
Regarding her relationship, SZA has been outspoken about her heartbreak in recent months.
Last month, she took to X (formerly Twitter) and declared that she wants love so bad, she wants to be “choked” in it.
