The Australian singer of hits like â€˜Spinning Aroundâ€™, â€˜The Loco-Motionâ€™, â€˜Canâ€™t Get You Out of My Headâ€™ and â€˜Padam Padamâ€™ is currently on her summer 2024 tour.
Minogue will be the seventh artist to headline this yearâ€™s BST, after SZA,Â Kings of Leon,Â Morgan Wallen,Â Robbie Williams,Â Shania Twain and Stevie Nicks. Sheâ€™s playing this Saturday on the penultimate day of the festival.

Kylieâ€™s headline set on the Great Oak Stage is on Saturday July 13 2024.

According to the Met Office, the weather wonâ€™t be awful but it wonâ€™t be great either. Expect a mix of sun and cloudiness, between 16C and 18C. While it might rain earlier in the day, the chances of precipitation decrease the longer the evening goes on.
