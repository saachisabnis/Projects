Fueling the buzz surrounding the up-and-comer, Drizzy took to his Instagram Stories on Monday (March 4) to share a screenshot of an audio file called “Date @ 8 REMIX S5V6b.”
In the post, he tagged 4Batz and his longtime producer Noah “40” Shebib alongside smiling devil emojis.

Drake’s post came just hours after 4Batz asked his 587,000 Instagram followers who they wanted on the remix of “act ii: date @ 8.”
Timbaland previously put out the idea of Drake remixing “act ii: date @ 8” in January.

“Uh oh, who dis kid? 4Batz. Dallas, y’all got one,” he said in an Instagram video while listening to the song for the first time. “Think y’all got one with this one. Yo, his tone is crazy.
“I’m telling you now, The Boy get on this, it’s outta here. It’s already outta here. This thing right here. And y’all know who The Boy is.”

The Toronto rapper later linked up with 4Batz in person, with the pair seen having a conversation during a concert in February.
“act ii: date @ 8” is only the singer’s third official release alongside its prequel “act i: stickerz ’99′” and sequel “act iii: on god? (she like),” which was released last week.
