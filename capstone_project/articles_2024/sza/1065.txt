(ThyBlackMan.com) The simmering tension between rap royalty Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar took center stage this week after Lamar’s surprise album GNX dropped with a fiery opening track, “Wacced Out Murals.” The song, laced with references to Lil Wayne and his iconic Tha Carter III, has left fans speculating that Kendrick may be subtly throwing shade at the New Orleans legend. But Lil Wayne, never one to shy away from speaking his mind, wasted no time firing back, letting the world know he’s not one to be messed with.
With Kendrick Lamar’s appointment as the headliner for the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show—an honor many thought should have gone to Lil Wayne in his hometown of New Orleans—the rift between the two artists appears to have deepened. Let’s dive into the unfolding drama that has the rap world buzzing.
Kendrick Lamar stunned fans with the surprise release of his new album, GNX, on November 22. The album, his first since 2022’s critically acclaimed Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, features an eclectic mix of producers, including Jack Antonoff, Kamasi Washington, Mustard, Terrace Martin, and Sounwave. It also includes uncredited guest vocals from SZA, adding to the project’s buzz.
But the standout moment from GNX came on its opening track, “Wacced Out Murals,” where Lamar delivers a line that set social media ablaze:
“Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud
Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down.”
While some fans saw this as a nod of respect to Wayne’s 2008 classic album, others detected a deeper undercurrent—a subtle jab at Wayne for what Lamar perceives as a decline in relevance or artistry. Kendrick’s lyrics continue with a sharp edge:
“Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me
All these n***** agitated, I’m just glad they showin’ they faces.”
The references to the Super Bowl, a nod to Kendrick’s recently announced headliner spot, felt pointed. Was Kendrick suggesting that Wayne’s dissatisfaction with being overlooked for the halftime show was more personal than professional?
Lil Wayne’s reaction was swift and characteristically bold. Taking to X (formerly Twitter) on November 23, he expressed his confusion and frustration:
“Man wtf I do?! I just be chillin & dey still kome 4 my head. Let’s not take kindness for weakness. Let this giant sleep. I beg u all. No one really wants destruction, not even me but I shall destroy if disturbed. On me. Love.”
Wayne’s words carried a mix of hurt and warning—a reminder that while he may be a seasoned veteran in the game, he’s not one to be disrespected. Fans were quick to rally behind him, with many taking issue with Lamar’s perceived slight.
The controversy takes on added significance given that the 2025 Super Bowl will be held in New Orleans. Many fans and locals felt that Lil Wayne, as one of the city’s most celebrated sons, should have been the obvious choice to headline the halftime show. Wayne himself addressed the snub in an emotional Instagram post:
“That hurt. Hurt a lot, you know what I’m talking about, hurt a whole lot… I thought that was nothing better than that spot on that stage on that platform in my city. So it hurt. It hurt a whole lot.”
Wayne’s heartfelt confession resonated with fans, who flooded social media with calls for justice, declaring that no one represents New Orleans like Lil Wayne. For them, seeing Kendrick Lamar take the stage in their city feels like a missed opportunity to honor their own.
On the other side, Kendrick Lamar’s lyrics on “Wacced Out Murals” seem to carry an air of defiance. His mention of Nas, who congratulated him on securing the Super Bowl gig, contrasts sharply with the “agitated” responses of others—seemingly aimed at Wayne and his supporters.
Adding to the intrigue, Kendrick raps:
“All these n***** agitated, I’m just glad they showin’ they faces.”
Could this be Kendrick’s way of addressing the backlash head-on, calling out those who criticize him while he continues to dominate the game? Or is it simply a reflection of the competitive nature of hip-hop, where even perceived slights can spiral into full-blown beefs?
In New Orleans, the debate over the Super Bowl halftime show has sparked heated conversations. While some locals are excited to see an artist of Kendrick Lamar’s caliber take the stage, others feel that Wayne’s contributions to the city’s culture and music should have been recognized.
One fan tweeted:
“Wayne IS New Orleans. How they gonna have the Super Bowl here and not let him perform? Disrespectful.”
Another countered:
“Kendrick’s the GOAT. He’s got the catalog and the stage presence. This ain’t about city politics—it’s about who can put on the best show.”
The divide highlights the complexity of the situation, with both artists commanding immense respect and loyalty from their fans.
While Kendrick has not explicitly confirmed any bad blood, the timing and tone of his lyrics have left many wondering. Wayne’s response, coupled with his earlier disappointment over the Super Bowl snub, suggests that he feels targeted.
Hip-hop has long been a space for lyrical jabs and subliminal disses, and Kendrick is no stranger to the art of the veiled insult. Whether or not he intended to take a shot at Wayne, the impact of his words is undeniable.
Interestingly, Wayne isn’t the only rapper mentioned on GNX. “Wacced Out Murals” also references Snoop Dogg in the lines:
“Snoop posted ‘Taylor Made,’ I prayed it was the edibles
I couldn’t believe it, it was only right for me to let it go.”
Snoop, ever the good sport, responded on X with a string of fire emojis, brushing off any potential tension with humor. The contrast between Snoop’s reaction and Wayne’s highlights the differing dynamics at play.
As the dust settles, fans are left wondering whether this will escalate into a full-blown feud or if cooler heads will prevail. Both artists have much to lose and much to gain from a potential clash. For Wayne, reclaiming his spot as a cultural icon in his hometown is a matter of pride. For Kendrick, solidifying his legacy as one of hip-hop’s greatest means staying above the fray.
Either way, the rap world will be watching closely. With the Super Bowl halftime show on the horizon, and GNX continuing to dominate the charts, the stage is set for more drama—and possibly more music.
One thing is certain: when it comes to Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar, the story is far from over.
