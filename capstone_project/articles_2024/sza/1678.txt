The Brit Awards 2024 are over after a long night of red carpet looks, teary speeches and stellar performances – but viewers were left a little deflated for a fairly sizable reason. 
Hosted by Love Island host Maya Jama, radio presenter Roman Kemp and Clara Amfo, the London’s O2 Arena saw Raye, 26, take to the stage to scoop a record-breaking six Brit Awards, having been nominated for seven. 
But while the crowd were treated to a spirited opening performance by Dua Lipa, an iconic ending medley of hits from Kylie Minogue, and the gorgeous moment Raye stood on stage with her grandma after cleaning up the prizes, viewers couldn’t get over one big downside: the audience. 
While the hosts made little fun asides, and Roman tried to get the party going by doing shoeys with Kylie, the audience didn’t seem to take to the evening as viewers had expected. 
‘#BritAwards Is there even anyone in the audience?’ asked X user @hayleydavies121, before adding: ‘#BritAwards Can we just give the audience a few drinks. It might liven them up a bit.’ 
‘This is all so awkward? Why are the crowd essentially silent and not responding to anything the presenters or artists are saying?!’ asked @AshleighAnn11. 
Viewer @Brooksie19811 commented: ‘I remember when the #BritAwards was must watch tv, drunk celebs, stars jumping on stage interrupting performances, anything could happen, now it’s just a dull non event, you know nothing shocking will happen!’ 
Agreeing, @_mxedemotions asked: ‘has the audience been sedated tonight? #BritAwards.’ 
‘It hurts to watch but I’m afraid to miss the car crash if I turn over #BritAwards,’ said a reluctantly hooked @fxlloutstump. 
‘I’m howling at how inconvenienced the audience looks to be attending this,’ said @GraceESaunders.
Metro.co.uk understands that the atmosphere at the live event was more positive than viewers interpreted it to be from home.

In the perhaps the spiciest moment of the evening, Roman appeared to reference the controversy surrounding F1 Red Bull team principle Christian Horner, as he commented that the ceremony was ‘busier than Red Bull’s press office’. 
It was Raye’s night from the off as she took home the first trophy for song of the year for Escapism featuring 070 Shake.
‘I’m shaking, wow,’ she said. ‘I don’t really know what to say, thank you to my team, I’ve always wanted to say thank you to my team.’
Raye added that ‘no one would take me’ before her music distributors agreed to back her, as she went on stage – barefoot, icon – to scoop best album for My 21st Century Blues, best song, best R’n’B Act, best breakthrough artist, best artist, and she became the first female artist to win songwriter of the year. 
The Brit School alumni signed to Polydor Records as a teenager in 2014 and lended her vocals to top hits by David Guetta and Jax Jones and writing lyrics for Beyonce and Rihanna.
Raye claimed in 2021 that Polydor Records prevented her from releasing an album. 
In a series of posts to X she wrote: ‘Imagine this pain. I have been signed to a major label since 2014… and I have had albums on albums of music sat in folders collecting dust, songs I am now giving away to A list artists because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough to release an album.’
The Londoner said she had ‘done everything’ they asked her to do, including switching genres and working long weeks.
‘I’m done being a polite pop star. I want to make my album now, please that is all I want,’ she said.
Less than a month later she was dropped by the label and emerged as an independent artist.
