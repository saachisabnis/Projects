Alex Landi is returning to his Korean roots with his latest show, Mr. Plankton, a 10-episode series filmed on the beautiful island of Jeju in South Korea. Directed by Hong Jong-chan, with a story written by Jo Yong–the writer of the popular K-Drama It’s Okay to Not Be Okay)–the series stars Landi as John Na, a subordinate to Beom Ho-Ja (Kim Hae-Sook).
