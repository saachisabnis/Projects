It looks like hip hop star Kendrick Lamar is preparing to take a victory lap across the country after winning his beef with Drake, dropping a hot new album called "GNX" and preparing for the Super Bowl Halftime Show.
The first single from GNX "Squabble Up" has already racked up 13 million views in a week on YouTube and most of the album's 12 songs dominate the streaming charts.
While 2024 has been Kendrick's year, 2023 was without a doubt a huge year for his label mate SZA who also hosted a super successful tour after her phenomenal album "S.O.S' dominated the charts.
The duo have crafted several smash hits together and their chemistry is undeniable as proven once again on Lamar's new album with the song "luther" which we're spinning right now on Kiss-FM!
The duo has announced that they are combining their musical powers and going on tour in 2025 with the Grand National Tour, presented by Live Nation, pgLang, and Top Dawg Entertainment.
The tour will be making stops across 19 STADIUMS across America including 2 stops in Texas:
