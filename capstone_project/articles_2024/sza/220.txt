Those who were eagerly awaiting the official release of LANA, the deluxe edition of SOS, have had quite a tough day.
On Saturday, January 6, leaks of what appeared to be unreleased tracks from SZA hit the internet. Shortly thereafter, the New Jersey native shared her frustration regarding the leaks with her X, formerly known as Twitter, followers.
“Leaking my music is stealing. This is my job. This is my life and my intellectual property. You are a f*cking thief and I promise to put maximum energy into holding everyone accountable to the full extent of the law. I am tired,” she tweeted.
TDE’s Punch also offered a message regarding the apparent leaked tracks. While he wasn’t as verbose as the Grammy Award winning act, he was stern and direct in his response.
“When music leaks it often lead to delays and/or canceling whole projects,” Punch added.
SZA teased the release of LANA via Instagram about two weeks before Christmas. At first, fans were hopeful the project would be released before her big night at the 66th Annual GRAMMY Awards. Now, listeners are just hoping it will hit streaming services at all.
