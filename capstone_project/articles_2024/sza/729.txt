Kendrick Lamar and SZA have announced dates for their Grand National Tour, a 19-date stadium run presented by Live Nation, pgLang, and Top Dawg Entertainment. The tour includes two performances at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on May 21 and May 23, 2025.
The tour kicks off on April 19 in Minneapolis, MN, and will visit major cities such as Houston, Atlanta, and Toronto before concluding in Washington, D.C., on June 18.
Tickets go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. on Friday, Dec. 6, at Ticketmaster.com. Fans can also take advantage of an exclusive Cash App Visa Card presale starting at 10 a.m. Wednesday, Dec. 4 through Thursday, Dec. 5. To participate, Cash App Cardholders can use the first nine digits of their card to unlock presale access and complete purchases using their Cash App Card. Additionally, cardholders will receive an instant 20% discount on official Grand National Tour merchandise purchased on-site during the event.
Lamar and SZA have collaborated on notable tracks such as “Doves in the Wind” from SZA’s debut studio record “CTRL” and the Oscar-nominated “All the Stars” from the Black Panther soundtrack. Their creative synergy continued with two collaborations on Lamar’s surprise album “GNX,” which dropped last month including “Luther,” which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and “Gloria,” the album’s closer. “GNX” has been a force on the charts, with seven of its tracks currently occupying spots in the Billboard Hot 100’s Top 10, including Lamar’s third No. 1 hit of the year, “Squabble Up.”
For SZA, this tour follows her highly successful SOS sophomore album and global tour. For Lamar, the Grand National Tour marks his first full stadium tour, capping a year of critical acclaim.
