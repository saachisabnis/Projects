Reason and Punch have some thoughts on a fan’s recent ranking of [most of] the Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) roster.
The list began circulating on Thursday (April 18), which found the artists on the Los Angeles-based record label ranked as follows:
1. Isaiah Rashad; 2. ScHoolboy Q; 3. SiR; 4. SZA; 5. Ab Soul; 6. Jay Rock; 7. Daylyt; 8. Ray Vaughn; 9. Lance Skiiiwalker; 10. Zacari; 11. Punch; 12. Reason.
Having landed at the bottom of the list, Reason took issue with the placement – but only because Doechii was left out and not put before him.

“See man this isn’t fair and I have a problem with this immensely!!! Smh,” he joked on Twitter/X. “Like this just proves yall pay no attention to music and what’s going on and I hate it! Smh I SHOULD BE 13! WHERE IS DOECHII??? [laughing emoji]”
Terrence “Punch” Henderson, who is President of TDE but also raps, had a much shorter reply, simply writing: “11 is crazy smh. lol”
Reason may not be under the TDE fold for much longer, however. Earlier this week, he seemingly hinted at a split from his longtime label after coming under fire for showing his support for Drake.
Shortly after Drizzy’s diss aimed at TDE alum Kendrick Lamar (among others) began circulating online, Reason took to X/Twitter to praise the song’s production.

“Nah this final production CRAZY,” he wrote in a since-deleted tweet.
Upon being called out for it, he simply replied with some laughing emojis and added: “I just like good production man.”

A blog page then tweeted that the rapper had been dropped from TDE, to which he responded with a cap emoji and: “Haven’t got no papers yet.”
When a fan asked for clarity on the “yet,” he seemed to confirm that the split is inevitable with: “Yea bro, been asking for a min.”

There seems to have been some tension between Reason and TDE for some time now as he alleged last summer that no one from the label showed up to his album listening party for Porches.
“I had a release party, and nobody showed up from the label, so…” he said on the Rory & Mal podcast.

When the hosts asked if Reason was being serious, he re-emphasized the point and answered: “Ray Vaughn showed up — shout out to Ray Vaughn. I took it as, y’know, maybe n-ggas giving me some space.”
