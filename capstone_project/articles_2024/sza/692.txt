The most anticipated event during Grammys weekend—besides the actual ceremony, of course—is Jay Z’s iconic Roc Nation brunch. The invite-only shindig celebrates Black excellence annually and is flooded with stars. Sadly, the glamorous gathering reportedly won’t be happening this year.
Roc Nation started the famous brunch in 2011 and after a two-year break due to COVID-19, it finally returned last year. Past guests have included Jay and Bey as well as Rihanna, Janelle Monae, Kevin Hart, Megan Thee Stallion, DJ Khaled, Tyler The Creator, Meek Mill, Chlöe and Halle Bailey, Lil’ Kim, Joey Badass, Tems, Babyface, Pusha T, and Kelly Rowland.
Per Page Six, Jay Z and Beyonce are expected to appear at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy gala on Saturday instead to show love for the Sony Music Publishing’s CEO, Jon Platt, who is being honored with the Grammy Salute to Industry Icons Award.
However, there have been a multitude of parties since Grammy week has commenced. From Black Music Coalition to the Grammy Museum to Amazon Music to Billboard to MusiCares, celebrities have been galavanting all over Los Angeles. 
The 66th Annual Grammys Awards airs live Sunday, Feb. 4 at 8 p.m. ET/ 5 p.m. PT on CBS and Paramount+. The ceremony boasts Trevor Noah as its host for the fourth year in a row. SZA leads the nominations, Root 100 honoree Jon Batiste is also nominated and breakout star Victoria Monét is one of the scheduled performers. 
In addition, country singer Luke Combs had a huge hit with his cover of Tracy Chapman’s classic “Fast Car.” Chapman will finally get her flowers for being groundbreaking in the singer/songwriter category as Variety reports she will join Combs for a duet at Sunday’s ceremony of her famous song.
