Dua Lipa attends the 29th Annual Critics Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on January 14, 2024 in Santa Monica, California.
Dua Lipa is embracing being her most authentic self in her recent cover story for Rolling Stone magazine. The "Houdini" singer opens up to the publication about her new era. She discusses how she has learned to navigate the cutthroat music industry. At 28 years old, the pop star admits, "I am literally getting thrown into life right now." She notes that she has been dragged by her feet with all the upheaval and transformations at this stage of life.
Her highly anticipated third album is due later this year. Lipa reveals themes about these major changes in her life will be reflected in the new music. Some of those changes include that she recently parted ways with the management firm that represented her for a decade. Additionally, she bought back the rights to her music. Focusing entirely on keeping her private life separate from her celebrity, Dua tells the publication that she prefers to keep her distance from controversies. Especially when it comes to the toxicity that comes with social media. The Grammy winner doesn't want to feed into the opinions of others affecting her daily life. "Itâ€™s just important to be able to take things with a pinch of salt," she says.
Even when it comes to taking vacations, Lipa was judged for not being home most of 2023 and instead hopping from country to country on vacation following her Future Nostalgia tour that wrapped in late 2022. "I was going to f---ing holiday and chill," the artist says about working hard and playing hard. She also took a jab at "how short our attention span is" because music comes out so much faster than it used to, with fans expecting new music to drop when they want it. Adding that there has always been "so much toxicity in the way people wanted their artists or their musicians." She notes that many artists who we think of as icons today, did not have to deal with the immediacy of social media.

Some celebrities have made it obvious that they speak another language. Whether it is from a thick accent or speaking in another language in films or music, we can easily tell when someone is multilingual. However, there are some stars we would have never guessed spoke in anything besides their native tongue. The biggest surprise of all is when our favorite actor or musician speaks more than two languages!
Due to their cultural heritage, some stars have picked up a second language due to where their family is from. Others have found a love for language in their travels or a genuine interest in linguistics.
