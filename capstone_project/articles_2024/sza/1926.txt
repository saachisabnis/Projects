Fresh off a stint as the musical guest on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” 21 Savage is returning to the stage.
The 31-year-old British rapper just announced his ‘American Dream Tour’ — which shares a name with his recently released album — alongside special guests J.I.D., Nardo Wick, and 21 Lil Harold that will send them to venues all over the U.S. and Canada this May and June.
Midway through the run, the Grammy winning artist is scheduled to swing into Queens, NY’s Governors Ball Music Festival on June 8 and Camden, NJ’s Freedom Mortgage Pavilion on June 9.
While 21 Savage has co-headlined with Drake and J. Cole these past few years, the ‘American Dream Tour’ will be his first proper headlining North American tour since 2019’s ‘I Am > I Was Tour.’

After six years since his last official studio album, 21 Savage dropped “American Dream” on Jan. 12, 2024.
His third record, comprised of 15 tracks, comments on the struggles 21 Savage faced to acquire his green card.
Once the music takes off — after a rousing spoken word intro — drum-heavy beats, retro samples and 21’s slick flow flood your eardrums.
For our money, “redrum,” “prove it” and “just like me” are “American Dream’s” standouts, although the record is all killer, no filler.

Over the past decade, 21 Savage has run into a number of legal issues.
In 2014, he was convicted of felony drug charges in Atlanta; four years later, the rapper took a firearm out at a party.
The following year, in 2019, he turned himself in at a South Georgia jail after a warrant was put out for his arrest. Three years prior, he was paid $17,000 for a concert he never performed and didn’t return the money. He was released on his own recognizance soon after.  
However, most notably, the British icon ran into immigration legal troubles after it was discovered his visa expired in 2006.
After years of back and forth, 21 Savage received his green card in October 2023. 
A number of the biggest names in the game are on the road this year.
Here are just five of our favorites you won’t want to miss live these next few months.
• Drake and 21 Savage
• Mariah The Scientist
• Offset
• A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie
