The inaugural “Sudden Little Thrills” festival, set to take place in Pittsburgh at Hazelwood Green on Sept. 7-8 has been canceled.
An announcement sent this morning from C3 Presents, the festival’s producer (Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits) states:
“We were excited to bring a new world-class music festival to Pittsburgh, however, due to circumstances beyond our control, the Sudden Little Thrills Festival will not take place in 2024.”
All posts on the social media accounts for the festival have been deleted.
The event had booked acts like The Killers, SZA, St. Vincent, Omar Apollo, Ethel Cain, Melanie Martinez, Hippo Campus and Crowded House, along with performers with Pittsburgh connections like Wiz Khalifa, Girl Talk, and local hip-hop artist, Fedd the God, singer-songwriter Corook, Hazlewood’s own Krunk and Center of Life Band and indie-rockers feeble little horse.
According to the announcement from C3 Presents, “Tickets purchased directly through Front Gate Tickets will be automatically refunded in as little as 30 days to the original method of payment.”
This announcement marks the second large festival cancellation in Pittsburgh this year. Organizers of last year’s WonderWorks Festival had intended to host the event again at Hartwood Acres May 25 and 26, but neither a line-up or any additional information was announced.
