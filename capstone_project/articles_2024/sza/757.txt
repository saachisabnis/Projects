As 2024 winds down, we want to thank you for being part of Fusion in the Afternoon this year. From inspiring moments in hip-hop, pop culture, to Madison’s vibrant community, it’s been a year to remember. Here’s wishing you a joyful and prosperous New Year as we step into 2025 together!
Beyoncé’s Halftime Dominance
Netflix made waves this holiday season with its first-ever NFL broadcast, but it was Beyoncé’s halftime performance that stole the spotlight. Drawing a staggering 27 million viewers, the Queen Bey outshined even the games themselves. Fans dubbed it the #BeyonceBowl, and social media buzzed with praise for her electrifying set.
The event marked a groundbreaking partnership between Netflix and the NFL, and with other major artists like Post Malone joining the stage, it was a reminder of music’s power to unite audiences. Posty even took a moment to thank Beyoncé for letting him be part of the magic. It’s no surprise this is being hailed as a game-changing moment for streaming events.

Drake’s Ambitious TV Pitch
Drake’s entrepreneurial spirit knows no bounds. In a bold move, he pitched a “God’s Plan”-inspired TV series to Jeff Bezos. The concept? A heartfelt anthology of uplifting stories where people experience life-changing acts of kindness. Think viral moments with real emotional depth—and Drake at the helm.
The idea has sparked interest from Amazon, and fans are already imagining how this could bring a new layer of meaning to one of his biggest hits. Can Drizzy take the crown in both music and television? We’ll be watching.
Common Declares Kendrick the Winner
The Drake vs. Kendrick debate has been one of hip-hop’s most enduring rivalries, and Common has now weighed in. Declaring Kendrick Lamar the victor, Common praised his ability to blend artistry with cultural impact, calling him “a poet who reshapes the world.”
But Common didn’t dismiss Drake, acknowledging his unmatched versatility and connection to the masses. Fans online remain divided, with some calling for a collaboration between these two icons. Whether you side with Kendrick’s lyrical genius or Drake’s chart-topping dominance, one thing is clear: both artists have left an indelible mark on hip-hop.

Whether you’re looking to dance, laugh, or keep it chill with the family, Madison is the place to be as we say goodbye to 2024.

SZA Reigns Supreme
SZA’s “SOS” has returned to the top of the Billboard 200, thanks to the deluxe Lana edition. Featuring unreleased tracks and a collaboration with Lana Del Rey, the re-release has reignited fan fervor. Social media has been buzzing with reactions like, “This is SZA’s era, and we’re just living in it.”
This comeback speaks to SZA’s ability to create timeless music that resonates long after its initial release. Few artists manage to reclaim the #1 spot a year later, solidifying her as a trailblazer in modern R&B.
