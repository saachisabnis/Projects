The Songwriters Hall of Fame has announced its 2024 induction ceremony and award gala details. The 53rd annual gathering will be held on Thursday, June 13, at the Marriot Marquis Hotel in New York City. According to the official press release, more names have been added to various contributor roles for the night of musical esteem, including Trey Anastasio, who will present and/or perform on Wednesday night. 
This year’s event will celebrate the exceptional contributions of Hillary Lindsey, Timothy Mosley (Timbaland), Dean Pitchford, Donald Fagen, Walter Becker (Steely Dan), and the iconic members of R.E.M., Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe. These luminaries, with their remarkable body of work, have left an indelible mark on the music industry. The evening will also see the bestowal of individualized awards, with the Hal David Starlight Award honoring SZA and the prestigious Johnny Mercer Award recognizing the unparalleled talent of Diane Warren. 
The songwriters above had to supply a notable catalog of songs, and for induction consideration, rules imply eligibility only kicks into effect after 20 years from the first commercial release for a single song. Of the 10,000-plus artists, only 400 have been presented with the venerable honor. Past honorees include Smokey Robinson, Bob Dylan, Carole King, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Loretta Lynn, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Collins, Elvis Costello, Marvin Gaye, Nile  Rodgers & Bernard Edwards and others. 
Tickets for the Songwriters Hall of Fame event are available. The net proceeds benefit the Songwriters Hall of Fame programs, a 501(c)3 organization.
