Jess Hilarious is officially joining “The Breakfast Club” as the show’s third co-host.
The popular radio show didn’t have a third co-host since Angela Yee left on Dec. 2, 2022. Hilarious was one of the show’s frequent guest co-hosts. She went viral when Sexyy Red came on the show for an interview and ignored Hilarious after she previously mocking Red.
