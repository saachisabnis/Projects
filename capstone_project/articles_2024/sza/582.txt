The openly gay rapper previously posted one of these snippets on X on Thursday (March 7).  It features sexually explicit lyrics about his youth.
“Grindr sessions sexing with faceless accounts/ Bringing bodies in me then sneaking them out/ Back in middle school I was fiending for dick/ 7th grade, sending my homies some pics,” he raps.
