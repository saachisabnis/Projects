Home    Forums    Music    Grammy 2025 Predictions: R&B Field
Thought I would kick off the discussion for the R&B field for the 2025 Grammys, given we will be at the halfway point of the eligibility period by the end of this month (doesn’t feel like it at all).
Some current contenders I can think of:
Brent Faiyaz (Larger Than Life album could be a Progressive R&B contender)
Justin Timberlake (new album in March, lead single “Selfish” is adult contemporary but R&B-leaning, not really sure if he’d submit to pop or R&B tbh)
Kehlani (has confirmed album is coming out this year, hasn’t been nominated since 2018 though so let’s see)
Muni Long (her new song “Made For Me” is going viral on social media, potential chance at a nomination given her win in 2022)
SZA (she is dropping new album Lana soon, she is a strong contender and likely a lock across the R&B field)
Reneé Rapp (just one song in particular, the Tummy Hurts remix with Coco Jones. Would be a nice R&B song/performance nomination)
Usher (new album Coming Home out 9th Feb, can definitely see him getting a R&B Album nomination, likely in song categories too but not sure what he’d submit yet)
“Made For Me” seems like the standout so far, but we’ll see. 
I think Muni Long will have to submit a live version of Made For Me for it to be eligible
I Want You Forever by Jeymes Samuel, D’Angelo and Jay-Z also seems like a big contender for Best Traditional R&B Performance
‘saturn’ is really beautiful and i loved the performance. the snippets we’ve had from ‘lana’ sound a bit softer and potentially a little bit closer to the ‘traditional’ r&b sound the r&b voters tend to go for
Honey, Justin Timberlake’s white culture-appropriating ass better NOT end up in R&B (and win) again.
I think Muni Long will have to submit a live version of Made For Me for it to be eligible
Was it submitted last year? If not, then it could still be eligible, especially if she submits it as an album track.
Made For Me was submitted last year for GF & R&B Cats.
USHER for Coming Home 🙂 in R&B Album. When the album comes out, we will have to see what song he’ll push next.
“Made For Me” seems like the standout so far, but we’ll see. 
hoping for R&B performance noms (obviously) but hopefully wins as well !!!! 
Hiatus Kaiyote released a stunning track called “Everything’s Beautiful”. It may be the lead single of a new album. Also, BADBADNOTGOOD’s “Take What’s Given” is already one of my favorite tracks of the year, I’d love to see it nominated for Best Traditional R&B Performance.

Trad. R&B is packed. Some contenders I could think of that I think weren’t mentioned here:

It was already submitted last year. She would need a live version to eligible again.
Usher also submitted Good Good last year.
It’s a shame Made for Me was already submitted
Muni released the live version of Made For Me last week. 
Risk It All by Usher x H.E.R. definitely coming in R&B Performance
