Gear up for an epic final day of BST Hyde Park with K-pop titans Stray Kids
This yearâ€™s BST Hyde ParkÂ has been one for the ages. Huge stars from across the world have descended on central Londonâ€™s biggest park over the last month, withÂ SZA,Â Kings of Leon,Â Morgan Wallen,Â Robbie Williams,Â Shania Twain,Â Stevie NicksÂ and Kylie Minogue all performing headline sets. And this SundayÂ South KoreanÂ groupÂ Stray Kids will be seeing the festival out.Â 
This weekend marksÂ the first time that theÂ eight-member group are playing at a UK festival â€“ so itâ€™sÂ a pretty massiveÂ deal.Â Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin and I.N are BST Hyde Parkâ€™s final 2024 headliners.Â 
Planning on heading to see Stray Kids this Sunday? Hereâ€™s all the info you need to know.Â 
The K-pop band is performing on the Great Oak Stage in Hyde Park on Sunday July 14.Â

Theyâ€™llÂ take to the stage at 8.20pm and are due to finish at 10pm.Â
