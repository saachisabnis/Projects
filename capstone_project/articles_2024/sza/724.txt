Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams has expressed an interest in working with SZA for some time now. During an interview with Rolling Stone last year, she talked about her vision for the crossover.
“I’m such a fan of her voice,” she said about her peer. “And what I love about her voice is that she can easily slide around genre as well. Like she has plenty of songs throughout her catalog that feel very alternative to me and feel a little bit Strokes-y, in a way. She just has that thing.”

The 35-year-old added: “She’s like that person where I feel like we could write any type of song, and it would be cool. I would love to hear her on something that we wrote that’s more alternative-leaning, just because I think it would be interesting.
“We’ve talked back and forth about it for a long time. We both get really caught up in whatever we’re doing at the moment. But I fucking worship her regardless. I just think she’s wonderful.”

Prior to that, Williams made an appearance on the Black People Love Paramore podcast and revealed that she and SZA had been “sending texts weekly” to each other regarding the joint project.
The TDE superstar consulted with Williams while working on her most recent album, SOS.

“[The album was] literally me checking off goals,” she told People last year. “Just me wanting to be like, ‘Oh, I can do this. I don’t suck. Is it possible to achieve this specific goal?’
“And for each of those genres I would text people like Hayley Williams and be like, ‘Does it sound like I’m trying to do something that I shouldn’t be doing, or does it sound organic? Because it felt really natural to me, but you’re the queen of this, how does it sound to you?’ And she’d be like, ‘This is perfect.'”
