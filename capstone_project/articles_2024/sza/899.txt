Jodie Foster attends the 81st Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton on January 07, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California.
Jodie Foster wanted her sons to think she lead a normal life, so she lied about her acting career as they were growing up. The True Detective: Night Country star said during a recent appearance on The View that didn't want her sons Charlie and Christopher "to know me that way." Foster, who has been acting for almost her whole life, wanted her kids to know her as their mom and "the person who went away to work and stuff," Jodie explained during her January 19 appearance. Because she didn't want "Charlie" and "Kit" to be "confused" about what she did for work, Foster, 61, made her oldest, Charlie believe she worked in construction.
The Taxi Driver alum told the ladies of The View she would bring him on set as a toddler and bought him a plastic tool belt. For a really long time, Foster, who shares her kids with former partner, producer Cydney Bernard, that Charlie really believed she was a construction worker." Now, Charlie, 25, has followed his mother's footsteps in the entertainment industry. After high school, Charlie went to his mom's Alma mater at Yale, and took part in many school theater productions as an actor and crew member from 2017 to 2021. As for Kit, 22, he has no interest in the industry, nor does he or his brother have any interest in watching her movies.
However, on the HBO critically-acclaimed series that Foster stars in, she believes her kids will finally tune in because "they're really into that." However, Jodie noted that there are "a few films that I would never show them because I would be worried about being teased." Though they never saw her 1995 film Nell, her sons often tease her about her Oscar-nominated role. She portrays a young woman who was raised in isolation and struggles to communicate with the outside world. Foster began her career when she was just two years old. She appeared in commercials before making her acting debut in 1968 in the television series Mayberry R.F.D. She was a teen idol, starring in multiple Disney films, such as Napoleon and Samantha and Freaky Friday. Then, she had her breakthrough role at twelve years old as prostitute Iris Steensma in 1976â€™s Taxi Driver.

Some celebrities have made it obvious that they speak another language. Whether it is from a thick accent or speaking in another language in films or music, we can easily tell when someone is multilingual. However, there are some stars we would have never guessed spoke in anything besides their native tongue. The biggest surprise of all is when our favorite actor or musician speaks more than two languages!
