Twenty-twenty-four is shaping up to be another exciting year for Dua Lipa. After bagging a Brit Award earlier this month, on 13 March, she announced that her third studio album, Radical Optimism, would drop on 3 May. And less than 24 hours later? The “Training Season” songstress was revealed as one of Glastonbury’s four headliners for 2024.
Joining the Londoner on the Pyramid Stage will be Coldplay, the band’s fifth time getting top billing at Worthy Farm. Meanwhile, Grammy winner SZA will make her Glasto debut and Shania Twain has scooped the legends slot on Sunday afternoon. Also heading to Somerset come June: Little Simz, Janelle Monáe, Burna Boy, PJ Harvey, Olivia Dean and Ayra Starr.

Though the line-up leaves much to be desired – I’m still holding out for a certain Mr Wonder to be announced – the festival has made strides since last year’s announcement of all-male headliners (Arctic Monkeys, Guns’n’Roses and Elton John) left many fans cold.
As per tradition, the festival’s 2024 edition sold out in an hour when tickets were released back in November, but if you couldn’t secure your spot, the festival has organised a ticket raffle for those who donate to their emergency fundraiser supporting people affected by conflict.
