The Dallas-bred R&B singer has been making waves in recent months with his hypnotic hit, which has racked up over 76 million streams on Spotify and even cracked the Billboard Hot 100.
Timbaland previously put out the idea of Drake remixing “act ii: date @ 8” in January.
“Uh oh, who dis kid? 4Batz. Dallas, y’all got one,” he said in an Instagram video while listening to the song for the first time. “Think y’all got one with this one. Yo, his tone is crazy.

“I’m telling you now, The Boy get on this, it’s outta here. It’s already outta here. This thing right here. And y’all know who The Boy is.”
He added: “Oh, Batz, you gotta get — oh, the remix gon’ be stupid. Y’all, man.”
Drake even acknowledged Timbo’s suggestion by liking an Instagram post about a potential collaboration between them.
The Toronto rapper later linked up with 4Batz in person, with the pair seen having a conversation during a concert in February.

“act ii: date @ 8” is only the singer’s third official release alongside its prequel “act i: stickerz ’99′” and sequel “act iii: on god? (she like),” which was released last week.
Drake is not the only big name in 4Batz’s corner, with Kanye West and SZA among those who have also co-signed him.

The ski mask-clad star posted a photo of himself on FaceTime with Ye earlier this year, while the Chicago rap icon also named 4Batz as his favorite new artist.
It was reported in January that the viral sensation was at the center of a major label bidding war that involved Republic Records, Atlantic Records and Warner Records, although a deal has yet to be announced.
