SZA tapped actor Ben Stiller to help reveal the release date of her long-awaited album. On Tuesday, December 17, the TDE singer posted a clip of the "Severance" director driving in a car while singing her next single "Drive" from her Lana LP. In the caption, SZA shouted out the Apple+ thriller series and announced season two will air on January 17. Right below that announcement, the Grammy award-winner finally confirmed her SOS deluxe album will drop on December 20 and thanked Stiller for his unwavering support. "Thank you @benstiller!" she wrote in the caption. She also called him "the realest" in her Instagram Story. 
SZA's new project has been in the works for quite some time. The St. Louis began teasing the album's arrival over the past year by dropping songs like "Saturn" and alluding to the earthy theme with outrageous looks like her bug outfit on "Hot Ones." She ramped up the promo earlier this month in honor of SOS' second anniversary. After she told Kai Cenat the album would arrive before the end of the year, SZA hyped up her fans with a teaser of an unreleased song from the album. Fans will get to see SZA perform her new material while she's on the road for the "Grand National Tour" with Kendrick Lamar. The 19-city arena tour begins in Minneapolis on April 19, 2025, and will continue to other major cities including Atlanta, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Los Angeles. The tour will conclude in Washington, D.C. on June 18. Tickets are on sale now.
