SZA isn’t letting any body negativity on social media into 2025 and her latest move just proved it.
The “SOS” singer recently took to X/Twitter to silence an online troll who left bad comment about her body. The exchange happened after SZA left a comment on a resurfaced video of herself from 2020 that was taken as a part of a H&M’s Join the Recycling Revolution campaign. In it, the “Snooze” singer could be seen and heard in front of her mom’s house digging through a box of her old clothes picking out a skirt of hers that she planned on up-cycling.
As the video began to circulate, SZA saw it and wrote in the replies: “Covid was hard … my granny had just died .. I was hella depressed n masking . Not eating. Over working out. but I always had my childhood home to n get lost . Still do . Grateful to be in a much better mental space now. s/o to those days tho.”
Despite the uplifting message, one user decided to also respond to the video adding to the sentiment in the original post and saying that they missed that era of SZA too, “before she got big and bbl culture like.”
After seeing it, the “Good Days” singer had enough of the chatter and responded back to the user saying: “Yall say weird shit like this and wonder why I’m different and don’t feel comfortable w yall anymore . Lol.”
SZA has been open about her body insecurities and her BBL before, as we’ve even told you previously. But it’s particularly nasty when someone tries to come at you in a negative manner when you’re expressing how much of a better place you’re in. Thankfully, SZA handled this with grace but that user might ought to think twice before trying to rain on someone else’s parade or make bleak comments about someone else’s body.
