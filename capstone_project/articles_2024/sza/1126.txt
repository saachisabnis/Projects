Glastonbury kicked off with a bang last night - with revellers seen enjoying laughing gas balloons and buying 'vegan alternatives to cocaine' at the start of a five-day music extravaganza.
Around 200,000 festival-goers are descending on Worthy Farm to enjoy a weekend at the iconic music event being headlined by Dua Lipa, Coldplay and country legend Shania Twain.
But revellers travelling to Somerset are battling rail chaos out of London Paddington station after a person died on the tracks - resulting in mass cancellations and delays on Elizabeth line, Great Western Railway and Heathrow Express services. 
After a 30C heatwave, this morning started off a damp squib as the heavens opened - with pictures showing them taking outdoor showers and retreating to their cardboard tents. Later, Joe Wicks led a workout session at the Circus field and posed for selfies with fans, while other festival-goers went on a 5K run around Worthy Farm.
Last night, festivalgoers were pictured inhaling 'laughing gas' from balloons on the grass. Elsewhere, a small mobile cart saw entrepreneurs flogging little bottles claiming to contain the 'vegan alternative to cocaine'. 
The brand, Karmaceuticals, advertises its product on Facebook as a 'tool' to 'help you be your best authentic self and boss Glasto weekend like an absolute legend'. The substance is not actually cocaine and is legal to sell. It claims to prevent 'over-consumption, over-stimulation and burn-out' by sustaining high octane levels.
Meanwhile, many ticketholders enjoyed the festival's first ever drone show as well as a peace parade. And the Met Office told fans to brace for rain and cloud today before spells of sunshine later.

It is expected to be 'a little breezy' with a high of 21C. The weather across the weekend is expected to stay 'mostly dry with plenty of sunny spells' and temperatures around average for June, dropping to 18C on Friday before rising to 19C and 21C on Saturday and Sunday respectively.
The festival comes amid planned industrial action by junior doctors, with NHS Somerset sharing tips on how to 'stay well' during periods of hot weather to help 'ease pressure on health and care'.
'We know that services will be under pressure this week,' Dr Bernie Marden, chief medical officer for NHS Somerset, said.
'With Glastonbury Festival also taking place this week and expected warm weather, we are sharing a few reminders about simple steps people can take to look after themselves, and stay healthy and well.'
This year's event will see headline performances from global stars including pop singer Dua Lipa, British rock band Coldplay and American soul singer Sza, while Canadian country star Shania Twain will play the coveted legends slot.

However, music fans travelling to Glastonbury Festival by train today have also experienced disruption.
Great Western Railway (GWR) said all lines are blocked at West Ealing in west London due to 'the emergency services dealing with an incident near the railway'.
That is affecting services to and from London Paddington, which is on the route serving Castle Cary, the nearest station to Glastonbury Festival.
Passengers are being warned to expect disruption until midday.
Dozens of people sat on the floor at London Paddington near the boarding area for Castle Cary services.
Hannah Yates, 28, from north London, who was booked on a train with four friends, said: 'I went up to (a member of staff) and they said there's been a fatality on the line and to wait for 45 minutes, so we're waiting for the next announcement.

'It's frustrating, I would say. This was a day that's already quite stressful so this adds to it.'
Another festivalgoer, who gave their name as Zac, said: 'We took the Elizabeth line here and they had cancelled the Elizabeth line to Heathrow so we had a suspicion.
'We're still looking forward to it - a couple of hours won't make a difference to the whole weekend.'
GWR said earlier this month that it planned to provide more than 28,600 seats on trains from London Paddington to Castle Cary between Wednesday and Friday for festivalgoers.
It warned that early and mid-morning trains on Wednesday and Thursday were almost fully booked. 
Other attractions at the festival, which runs from today until Sunday, include speeches, film screenings and Q&As, circus performances, comedy sets and more.
Hundreds of acts will perform on Thursday with various smaller stages across the site hosting acts including singer and DJ Shygirl and electronic musician Joy Orbison, who will both appear at dance stage Levels.

Also happening on Thursday, fitness expert Joe Wicks will lead a group exercise session for festival-goers - raising their heart rates at the Gateway stage.
Rock band Squeeze will open the Pyramid Stage on Friday at midday, followed by rising star Olivia Dean, K-pop group Seventeen and singer Paul Heaton.
Later on, PJ Harvey and LCD Soundsystem will warm up for Dua Lipa as she headlines the main stage on Friday night - her Pyramid Stage debut.
The 28-year-old pop star is expected to treat festival revellers to a selection of her hit songs, including Houdini and Training Season from her third studio album, Radical Optimism, released earlier this year.
Other highlights on Friday will include D-Block Europe and Idles playing the Other Stage, while Jungle top the bill on West Holts and Fontaines DC head up the Park Stage.
On Saturday, the main stage will welcome Nigerian stars Femi Kuti and Ayra Starr, followed by US 80s chart-topper Cyndi Lauper and rock band Keane.
Mercury Prize winner Michael Kiwanuka and British rapper Little Simz will also play on the Pyramid Stage in the evening before Coldplay top the bill. 
Meanwhile, Glastonbury founder Sir Michael Eavis is expected to do his traditional musical performance, covering a series of classics with his band.

Last year, hundreds of fans chanted 'Michael' as the veteran organiser, 88, was wheeled on to The Park Stage on an office chair to perform as he recovered from an operation on his leg.
It comes after Glastonbury Festival goers complained of being left for hours in queues without water in the sweltering heat yesterday.
As temperatures hit 28C in Somerset, festival attendees warned there could be 'mass strokes' as they moaned about the lack of available water stations while queueing for hours to enter Worthy Farm.
Videos showed thousands of people lined up carrying rucksacks and mats and wearing sun hats, as they waited to get into campsites.
Although music could be heard blaring, revellers reported there was no water available for those standing in the snaking five-hour queue.
Visitors branded the lack of water amid the sizzling temperatures a 'joke', adding that coach companies had also failed to hydrate passengers while bussing them to the festival. 
Fans also say they are ready to have their 'minds blown' by a new fire-belching dragonfly installation at Arcadia, a prime destination for late-night dance music at Glastonbury.
The Dragonfly, a reimagining of the flying insect built from an ex-military Royal Navy helicopter - turning 'a weapon of destruction into a unifying symbol', according to organisers.

They said its design is inspired by the arrival of the first dragonfly and the Aboriginal First Nations of Australia, and the stage will be opened each evening by a 'spectacular' ceremony called Warraloo alongside Aboriginal representatives of the Wadjuk Noongar. 
It replaces a giant metal arachnid which was a showpiece at the festival for well over a decade.
For most of that time, barring the installation of a giant crane called Pangea in 2019, Arcadia DJs have performed into the early hours in the Spider  which allows fans to gather beneath the artist and is surrounded by a dance lighting system and pyrotechnics which belch flames into the sky over the farm.
Festivalgoer Henno Tamms, who has travelled from the Netherlands for his third Glastonbury since 2017 and shared fond memories from the festival's famed dance area, said he was excited by his first sight of the new installation despite some fans' sadness about the change.
'A lot of people really loved the Arcadia spider ... a lot of people online were grieving like 'oh no the spider's dead again,' said the 27-year-old, who is currently unemployed, as workers made the final touches to the new installation behind him.
'But it looks promising, so we'll have to see ... maybe it's a birth of the new thing.
'They've blown our minds before, I'm sure they can do it again.'
Mr Tamms' friend Nam Goldstein, from New York, who he met through the festival in 2017, was similarly effusive about the dance offering at Arcadia, which finishes as late as 3am over the Glastonbury weekend.
'Even when they're testing the fire, you're like 'this is the place to be',' the 35-year-old IT worker said. 
'Even if I like the performers or not, there's something so magnificent about the ritual (at Arcadia)... with the music and when it's connecting together - it's incredible.'
Hundreds of acts will perform on Thursday with various smaller stages across the site hosting acts including singer and DJ Shygirl and electronic musician Joy Orbison, who will both appear at dance stage Levels.

Levels is situated in the Hayes Pavilion in the North West section of the festival area.

Dubbed 'woke-caine' entrepreneurs have been seen flogging little bottles claiming to contain the 'vegan alternative to cocaine'.
The flasks are made by the brand Karmaceuticals, which bills itself as the 'herbalist behind the hedonism', and are of its 'Sharp Wits' formulation.
It claims to prevent 'over-consumption, over-stimulation and burn-out'.
According to information on its website this concoction is a blend of ginseng, ginkgo and rosemary though it doesn't list the quantities. 
It adds that the product is 'engineered to prime your body and enhance cognitive sharpness, facilitating a seamless entry into a state of heightened focus and verbal fluency'. 
Ginseng 
Ginseng is the root of plant called panax which grows in Asia. 
It has been linked to numerous health benefits including reducing fatigue.
Some studies have suggested it acts as stimulant on the brain and can even boosts mental arithmetic.
However, other research has reached mixed results meaning the science on this isn't settled. 
Ginkgo
Ginkgo is a species of tree native to East Asia and has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for a variety of ailments. 
It contains antioxidants which help protect cells from damage and support blood circulation. 
In terms of the brain, some small studies where people took it for weeks found they had faster processing skills and better memories.
Rosemary
A common inclusion in herb gardens and Mediterranean cooking, some studies have suggested it can boost mental performance.
However, these were in experiments where people inhaled the scent of rosemary, not digested it. 
So how does it compare to cocaine?
Cocaine is a potent, as well as both addictive and illegal, stimulant that increases levels of a chemical called dopamine in the brain. 
Dopamine is associated with pleasure and reward and a surge of it induces a powerful rush that leads to people having heightened alertness, excitement, and confidence.
It can also be deadly. The Office for National Statistics recorded 857 deaths from cocaine in England and Wales in 2022, the latest data available. 
Nothing in 'vegan cocaine' is illegal or potentially deadly in amounts any person would normally consume. 
Isn't cocaine vegan anyway?
Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant, which on purely technical level, already makes it vegan.
However, many vegans dispute this given the toll the drug takes on both the environment and people.
