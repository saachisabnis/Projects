Rod Stewart will be asking Glastonbury “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy?” come June. 

	The 79-year-old singer will play the festival’s Sunday afternoon “legend slot,” it was revealed on Tuesday in Glastonbury’s first artist announcement for its 2025 edition. Stewart also posted on his social media in response to the news, writing that he is “absolutely thrilled.”

	“After all these years, I’m proud and ready and more than able to take the stage again to pleasure and titillate my friends at Glastonbury in June,” he wrote. “I’ll see you there!”

	Stewart last played Glastonbury in 2002, when he headlined alongside Coldplay and Stereophonics. Tuesday’s announcement makes him the first person in festival history to both headline and get legend billing.

	One of the bestselling music artists of all time, Stewart has released 32 studio albums since 1969, including this year’s “Swing Fever” with Jools Holland. Beyond “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy,” his hits include “Maggie May,” “All for Love,” “Sailing” and “I Don’t Want to Talk About It.”

	Last year’s legend slot was held by Shania Twain, who brought some country flair to Worthy Farm. She joined headliners Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA. Tickets for the 2025 festival went on sale earlier this month, selling out in just 35 minutes. Though the headliners won’t be announced until the spring, rumors are already flying about who will take to the Pyramid Stage, with the likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Eminem and Charli XCX in the mix.

	Glastonbury previously announced that 2026 will be a fallow year, meaning that a festival won’t be held, making demand for next summer’s event even higher.
