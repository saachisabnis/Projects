Coldplay will headline Glastonbury Festival tonight, for their fifth time.
The UK band topped the Pyramid Stage at Worthy Farm in 2002, 2005, 2011, and 2016, and will bring Saturday's music to a close this year. They follow Dua Lipa, who headlined last night, and SZA, who will close the festival on Sunday.
While Coldplay has not released a setlist ahead of their performance, they played at the Groupama Stadium in DÃ©cines-Charpieu, France, earlier this week, and wowed audiences with a number of their greatest hits.
