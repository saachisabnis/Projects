Glastonbury Festival has just dropped its much-awaited full line-up and set times, sending festival-goers into a frenzy of excitement as they count down the weeks until the iconic event at Worthy Farm. Taking to their official X account (the new go-to platform since Twitter's demise), Glastonbury made the big reveal earlier today (Tuesday, June 4), causing a buzz among music lovers who are eager to map out their festival itineraries.
The announcement from Glastonbury Festival read: "The full line-up for Glastonbury 2024 is here - with set times! Head to https://glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/line-up-2024/ to see it. Plus our official app launches this week! Artwork by @StanleyDonwood."
With hundreds of acts lined up to perform across four days, starting on Thursday, June 27, with smaller stages and tents, and the major stages like Pyramid Stage, Other Stage, Park Stage, and Woodsies kicking off from Friday, June 28, there's something for everyone. Headline acts include Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA, while Shania Twain will be gracing the Pyramid Stage for the Sunday Legend's Tea Time slot.
 What's more, Glastonbury's line-up is interactive, meaning if you're curious about an act, simply hover your cursor over their name for a pop-up description, reports Wales Online.

Eagle-eyed festival-goers are on high alert for the surprise acts that Glastonbury has up its sleeve, with The Glasto Thingy Twitter account revealing there are 28 'TBAs' to be unveiled at the event. Key slots include a 6pm show on Saturday, June 29 at Woodsies, a midnight set on the same day at Levels, a trio of mysterious B2Bs at Nowhere, and two intriguing TBAs (one at 4.30pm on Saturday, June 29, and another at 7.30pm on Sunday, June 30) at the BBC Introducing stage.
Last year, the enigmatic 'The Churn Ups' appeared on the Pyramid Stage schedule for Friday, sparking widespread speculation about their true identity, with many fans convinced it was the Foo Fighters in disguise. Dave Grohl, the band's iconic frontman, nearly spilled the beans himself, dropping major hints in a heartfelt letter to fans just before the festival kicked off.
Grohl shared a snapshot of his handwritten note on social media, expressing his gratitude towards the fans for their unwavering support: "Hey. It's been a while... Now that we've returned from our first run of shows, I felt compelled to reach out and thank you all for being there for us."
"Every night, when I see you singing, it makes me sing harder. When I see you screaming, it makes me scream louder. When I see your tears, it brings me to tears. And when I see your joy, it brings me joy."
"But, I see you... and it feels good to see you, churning up these emotions together. Because we've always done this together. Time and time again. See you soon, David."
