Keke Palmer and Sza in a buddy comedy produced by Issa Rae? Yes, Please! Reportedly, Palmer and Sza have signed on to star in this upcoming film under TriStar Pictures, with Rae producing via her HOORAE media company. This sure-to-be-hit is a lovechild of ColorCreative and Columbia Pictures, aka CoCre lab (Sony Pictures)--a diversity cohort that supports and develops diverse screenwriters’ original ideas for studio features. 
In 2022, Palmer and Sza both appeared on “Saturday Night Live,” and apparently, that’s when the stellar idea of putting the two in a comedy together was born. This will be Sza’s acting debut. Although Sza did appear in “Insecure’s” fourth season’s parody show within the show, “Looking For LaToya.”
There are no juicy details about the film. However, Lawrence Lamont, director of Rae’s “Rap Sh!t,” will lead the project with Syreeta Singleton, the showrunner of “Rap Sh!t,” writing the screenplay. The production team also includes Palmer’s Big Boss Productions and Macro Film Studios on board for financing and production. 
Yes, Keke Palmer! Get your coin! The 34-year-old actress is known to get a bag, and this production will be no different. They better get on it because the streets say the Marvel Universe has their eyes on Palmer. Oooh!
