Abramorama has obtained worldwide theatrical distribution rights for the artist Raye’s concert film titled Raye: My 21st Century Symphony Live At The Royal Albert Hall.
Raye recently presented the U.S. premiere of her concert film of the London show, My 21st Century Symphony, in New York, NY on September 24, 2024.
Prior to a limited theatrical release, the film opened with a one-night screening and post-film conversation on four screens at The Regal Union Square. The first three screens sold out so quickly they decided to add a fourth.
The concert film captures the singer’s performance at the iconic London venue featuring reconceptualized symphonic arrangements of songs from her debut album, My 21st Century Blues. Raye is joined by The Heritage Orchestra (conducted by Tom Richards), the youth gospel choir Flames Collective, and organist Anna Lapwood. Songs from the setlist include Oscar Winning Tears, Ice Cream Man, Worth It, and her most famous song, Escapism.
The film comes soon after she won six awards at this year’s Brit Awards, breaking a record for wins at a single ceremony. She also recently opened for Taylor Swift on her sold-out Eras Tour at London’s Wembley Stadium.
It has been the year of Raye, receiving nods from notable artists such as Beyoncé, Sza, and Taylor Swift. She also performed at Glastonbury, Reading, Leeds, Coachella, Lollapalooza, Fuji Rock, and Montreux Jazz Festival this year.
Director Paul Dugdale stated: “It was such a huge honour and a pleasure to be part of this landmark moment. Our sole ambition for this film was to try to help Raye tell her story and amplify her jaw-dropping performance. As a director, the show is a total gift, a virtuoso performance, exploring an entire spectrum of emotions. I’m so proud that we were invited to collaborate with Raye on something so important and inspiring, and blessed that we had such an incredible team to help achieve it.”
Abramorama’s President & Head of International Distribution Evan Saxon, added: “Abramorama is honored to bring Raye’s beautiful film to the biggest screens around the world, where she belongs. It’s clear to see why fans worldwide love Raye as director Paul Dugdale did an amazing job capturing her dynamic and emotionally charged performance at a sold-out Royal Albert Hall.”
