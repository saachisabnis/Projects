After making her Glastonbury debut as one of this year’s headliners, SZA has shocked fans by announcing she is taking a break from live shows.
The 34-year-old has said she is stepping away from that side of her career as she needs to focus on getting her ‘life together’ after a huge SOS tour, which ended at the Osheaga Festival in Montreal, Canada.
The Saturn hitmaker has had a steady climb to fame since her debut album Ctrl in 2017, releasing a second album in 2022 while a third is on the way.
With Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar nods for her tracks, Sza hit dizzying heights even before she was chosen to close Glastonbury 2024.
However, she is now taking a step back from live performances for an undisclosed length of time.
She made a brief statement on X and said: ‘Yesterday was my last show for a while. Finally bout to get my life together thank u God. (sic)’
The announcement comes a little out of the blue, especially with her new album, Lana, due to be released at some point this year.
Before her tweet, she had been interacting on the social platform with fans who were saying how ‘hype’ her gigs make them.
The Kill Bill hitmaker replied: ‘This makes me so happy cause that’s all I’m tryna do !!
‘I jus wanna capture yalls energy mix it up w mine add some love and throw it back. All within 90 mins… I love you (sic)’
Yesterday was my last show for a while . Finally bout to get my life together thank u God .
She limited the replies to her announcement but fans still sent messages of support to the star, mainly asking when the album would drop.
‘Does this mean you’re getting into the studio?? we need to hear that beautiful voice of yours again,’ asked stan account ctrl4lifeee on X.
‘Don’t forget to get that album together in the process,’ added kidddmarr as szasunset said: ‘Manifesting Lana is otw!’
Others were less optimistic about the album, as HastaRuego said: ‘This is not good news.’
Among the album pleas was a sweet message from typical_vibez, which said: ‘Have an amazing time off! Thank you for everything and may amazing things happen your way 💜🫶🏾’
Sza has said previously that she finds it difficult to exist in the spotlight and has been to multiple therapists over anxiety and mental health issues.
She told Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1: ‘So I’ve been really trying to get my spiritual hygiene together because I realised as of recent that a lot of this s*** is not normal. And I didn’t know how to process that experience.
‘And I was having a lot of lashing out and a lot of frustration. And there’s a lot of opinions, a lot of entitlement to your space, a lot of entitlement to your time, a lot of expectation.’
At her Glastonbury set, which was hit with sound issues and poor turnout, Sza added that she was ‘so nervous’ to take on the iconic stage.
She told the crowd: ‘Glastonbury, I was so nervous to be here with you today.
‘I’m so grateful, you have my deepest love and my deepest respect. I love you always, god bless you. Get home safely, my name is SZA, good night.’
This was one of the only times the All The Stars singer addressed the Sunday night crowd, choosing instead to power through her songs as she danced around the spectacular staging.
Overall, the gig was not very well received amid ongoing sound issues that plagued the weekend’s performances.
‘Whoever booked SZA for @glastonbury needs sacking,’ tweeted user Sonny at the time. ‘Worse turnout for the closing act I’ve ever seen.
‘Very sad for SZA but at this point, she is not at the level to close Glastonbury. Disaster. Place is empty.’
Metro.co.uk was on the ground and caught Sza’s set, which was immediately hindered by microphone issues and failed to win over the crowd after being on the backfoot.
One man told us he had never seen a Pyramid Stage performance in the seven years he had been going to Glastonbury so wanted to experience it — he left before her third song began.
While there were plenty of teenagers eagerly filling up the area in front of the stage, Sza was not able to entice a wider audience with her fairy-inspired set and minimal recognisable hits.
However, the star wasn’t the only one struggling as Shania Twain, Cyndi Lauper, and even opening headliner Dua Lipa were said to have sounded off while taking to the legendary Pyramid Stage.
