The 66th annual Grammy Awards kicked off last night in L.A at the Crypto.com Arena. Trevor Noah reprised his role as host for a fourth consecutive year, taking the stage at 8 p.m. EST. The ceremony featured performances by Burna Boy, Dua Lipa, Joni Mitchell and SZA; Billy Joel and Billie Eilish were there; songs that have been dominating charts and playlists—“On My Mama” by Victoria Monét, “Rich Flex” by Drake and 21 Savage, and Miley Cyrus's “Flowers” among them—were all up for awards. But before any gilded gramophones were handed out, the biggest names in music walked the red carpet in capital-F Fashion.
As years past have shown us, the Grammys red carpet is a singular sartorial playground—one where a haute couture clamshell gown (worn by Cardi B. in 2019), a hat seemingly made for storage (donned by Pharrell in 2015), and a dress that plunges lower than any dress has plunged before (iconized by Jennifer Lopez in 2000) are all acceptable. The dress code is more or less “Do You!” (even if doing you means arriving in an egg).
Last night's nominated artist have put pen to paper and laid vocals to tracks, communicating feelings and emotions that range from bliss to heartbreak, pride to insecurity. So, how they expressed themselves through fashion—on a night when their music is being celebrated in front of the world—was especially captivating. What a thrill to witness.
