Fresh off of headlining Glastonbury’s final night on Sunday, SZA unveiled a new Olympic promotional spot on Monday, with the Grammy-winning singer taking on 4-time medal winner Simone Biles in a handstand contest. The two stars initially fawn over each other, with Biles revealing that SZA used to be a gymnast herself. The singer downplays her skills, while praising Biles legendary athletic achievements, “I was nowhere as cool as you. I’ve never seen anything like you. No one has.” The pair then partake in a handstand contest, with SZA surprisingly winning by a few seconds. Biles just became the U.S. Olympic gymnastics champion at the Olympic trials over the weekend, even thrilling Taylor Swift by using her song, “…Ready For It” during her floor routine. The 2024 Summer Olympic Games take place at various locations throughout Paris from July 26 through August 11. (Rolling Stone)
