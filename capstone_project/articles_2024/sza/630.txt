The Breakfast Club‘s long search for a third co-host is over.
The long-running morning radio show on New York City’s Power 105.1 announced on Monday (January 29) that starting on February 5, comedian Jessica “Jess Hilarious” Moore will be joining Charlamagne Tha God and DJ Envy as a permanent co-host.

Hilarious will fill the slot that Angela Yee vacated in December 2022.
The Baltimore native is a comedian and actress who has appeared on shows like Rel and Wild ‘N Out and has more than 5.5 million Instagram followers.
“I’m very excited to have Jess Hilarious join The Breakfast Club. She is a force in her own right, an actress, comedian, podcaster, and now, the co-host of The Breakfast Club,” Thea Mitchem, iHeartMedia Executive Vice President of Programming, said in a statement.
“Jess was the standout choice to join Charlamagne and DJ Envy to build upon The Breakfast Club’s legacy of entertaining, informing and enlightening the community.”

The comedian weighed in as well, saying: “I’m looking forward to joining forces with one of the largest media platforms. I’m confident that taking the third seat at The Breakfast Club will show people that Jess Hilarious is not just comedy, but culture.”
The road to Hilarious joining the program has seemingly been a rocky one. She was a frequent guest host throughout 2023 and actually announced last month that she had been hired permanently.

However, in the weeks following her announcement, the radio station kept quiet and fans grew confused. Her soon-to-be co-hosts did as well.
Asked by TMZ about the host situation earlier this month, Charlamagne said: “I would really like to know. Everybody saw us rotating guest hosts last year and we said we were gonna start 2024 off with a new host and that hasn’t happened yet.”

The broadcaster also added that he was “not happy” with the situation and said there would be no more guest hosts. “I am done with the rotating of the guest hosts,” he stated.
Just days ago, Jess Hilarious took shots at her now-co-workers, calling Envy and Charlamagne “trash” for comparing SZA to Mary J. Blige.

Charlamagne poked fun at all the confusion and controversy in an Instagram post celebrating Hilarious’ new position. It begins with an audio montage of press coverage and commentary about The Breakfast Club‘s then-uncertain host situation, before revealing the comedian sitting on a throne, surrounded by Envy and Charlamagne.
Charlamagne captioned the post, “To Whom It May Concern.”
