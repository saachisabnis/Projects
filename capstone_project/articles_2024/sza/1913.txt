Halle Bailey is baby bumpin’ along in her latest TikTok video. 
The actress, who gave birth to her first child at the end of 2023, shared an old video of her pregnant self twerking to “Rich Baby Daddy” by Drake, Sexyy Red and SZA with sister Chlöe Bailey Wednesday.
The 23-year-old “Little Mermaid” star put her bare baby bump on full display as she and Chlöe performed the song’s trending TikTok dance with beaming grins across their faces.
Halle dressed casually in dark gray sweatpants and a black sports bra, while her sister rocked a matching velour sweatsuit and corset-style tank top. 
Fans were amused by the energetic dancing video and pleased that the singer and actress chose to give them a glimpse of her baby bump after concealing her entire pregnancy.
“Please the baby bump is so cute,” one wrote. 
“Her bump was adorbs omg,” another gushed.
A third fan added, “I love how y’all are posting these cuz we know by now…so sweet☺️🤍.”
For more Page Six you love…
While the “Color Purple” actress never confirmed her pregnancy, fans were convinced she was hiding a baby bump ever since she wore a suspiciously flowy gown to the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, where an insider told Page Six she “was very mindful in the way she gave hugs, and who she gave them to.”
She was also seen trying to conceal her baby bump during a Santa Monica, Calif., outing in October 2023 with her boyfriend, rapper and YouTuber DDG.
She was adamant about keeping her pregnancy private, though, and even pleaded with fans to leave her alone amid their constant pregnancy speculation and nagging. 
Eventually, on Jan. 6, Halle announced she had given birth to her and DDG’s first child, a son named Halo, by sharing a sweet photo of them holding his little hand. 
She then gave fans their first glimpse of her baby bump by sharing a video from her underwater maternity shoot earlier this week. 
She channeled her onscreen character of Ariel as she posed beneath the water in a metallic crop top and a low-waist maxi skirt that put her belly front and center. 
She also wore a dreamy sheer dress, which gracefully flowed around her as she moved in the water.
“🧜🏽‍♀️missing my belly already 💜but i obviously had to do underwater pics 😉,” she captioned the post. 
Halle and DDG’s son may be a newborn, but he’s already making his way into the entertainment industry, as he appeared in DDG’s music video for “Darryl Freestyle,” which was released Jan. 6. 
In the short appearance, DDG can be seen cradling Halo in his arms as he is wrapped in a white blanket.
