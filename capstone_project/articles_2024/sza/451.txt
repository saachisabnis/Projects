Jack Harlow is officially launching his own music festival in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. The artist took to social media to announce the two-day Gazebo Festival, as well as the lineup. Slated to take place this spring, the festival is set to be held at Louisville’s Waterfront Park.
Consisting of 26 acts across two stages, Harlow himself is expected to co-headline the festival along with SZA, James Blake and Omar Apollo. Other performers include PinkPantheress, Vince Staples, Amaarae, Channel Tres, Slum Village, Majid Jordan and more. As a way to give back to his community, a portion of each ticket sale is set to go to local organizations through his own Jack Harlow Foundation, which the rapper set up last year. 
Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said in a statement, “Jack Harlow is an extraordinary Louisvillian who continues to give back to his hometown. This is yet another way Jack is showing up for our city and I can’t wait to see the excitement this festival creates. I am so grateful for his commitment to making first class things happen for Louisville and our people.” Presales for the Gazebo Festival happening on May 25 and 26 go online on March 6 at 10 a.m. ET with general release tickets on March 8 at 10 a.m. ET online.
