Louise, who shares sons Charley, 20, and Beau, 15, with ex-husband and former football star Jamie, has recently found love again with businessman Drew Michael, reports OK!. It marks her first public relationship since her marriage ended. Louise has openly discussed her decision to remain single for a long time out of consideration for her family, explaining: "I've felt this as a mum and, to say this in the most sort of respectful way, my boys' lives changed dramatically and then it changed again when obviously Jamie got married and had a family. Their life changed and I felt like I needed to be their one staple. That's just something I think a lot of mums would feel."
Over the summer, Louise was seen enjoying Glastonbury Festival with her beau Drew, and she even posted a series of snaps from their fun-filled weekend, captioning it: "Thank you Glastonbury 2024."
