Carrie Underwood was among the stars on hand to honor country songwriter Hillary Lindsey and more during the Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Thursday (June 13).
Keith Urban and Jason Isbell were two more country artists who participated, with Isbell providing one of the night's most unexpected moments.
“Girl Crush,” “Fearless,” “Blessed” and "Every Storm (Runs out of Rain)” are four of the dozens of hits Lindsey has written. For years she’s been one of Underwood’s preferred songwriters.
On the red carpet, Underwood wore a metallic dress with a billowing fabric skirt and metallic sandals. She kept the same look as she introduced Lindsey and performed. A pair of bracelets and matching necklace completed her look.
Photos find her and Urban with Lindsey, as well as an assortment of other stars familiar to country audiences. Isbell walked the red carpet solo and performed to honor R.E.M. The group stunned the crowd with a performance of "Losing My Religion," but before that, Isbell took a deep breath and ran through all the words of "It's the End of the World as We Know It."
