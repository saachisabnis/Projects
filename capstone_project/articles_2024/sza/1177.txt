The Lollapalooza 2024 lineup is here. With SZA, Tyler, The Creator and Blink-182 leading the list of headliners – along with The Killers and Future x Metro Boomin among others – this year’s festival is gathering quite the range of top-charting talent from all genres in Chicago’s Grant Park.
Other headliners include Hozier, Stray Kids, Melanie Martinez and Skrillex.
Elsewhere, Deftones, Faye Webster, Teezo Touchdown, Vince Staples, Killer Mike, Zedd, Dominic Fike, Labrinth, Kevin Abstract, Ethel Cain, Two Door Cinema Club, SiR, Eyedress and Veeze are slated to perform.
A common theme this festival season: female rap and R&B artists are showing up in numbers. Sexyy Red, Victoria Monét, Kaliii and FLO will all take the stage over the course of the four-day festival “weekend.”
