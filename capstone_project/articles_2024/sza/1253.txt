ScHoolboy Q is hardly old, having just turned 37 in October, but the Los Angeles native let a fan who claimed he was “late in his career” know that he plans to do this for many more decades to come.
The exchange went down on Twitter/X on Thursday (February 15). What was meant to be a compliment on his new work came out as a bit ageist, but Q was quick to correct the fan in question.

“@ScHoolboyQ may be releasing his best project so late in his career,” the fan wrote. “Everything about Blue Lips is magnificent. Rapping,Visuals & Rolllout.”
With a repost, Q replied: “Late? Told y’all on blank face I’m goin out like B.B king… I’m rapping til I’m 80 on god.”
ScHoolboy Q announced earlier this month that his new album Blue Lips will be released on March 1. The 17-track effort will include a guest verse from Freddie Gibbs — who Q admitted “washed” him — but no other features have been revealed as of yet.
The Top Dawg Entertainment rapper has been teasing a new album for some time, most recently saying in December that he had “something special” up his sleeve.

Before that, Q reposted a video on social media of the hosts of the Back On Figg podcast sharing insight into his forthcoming project.
“We been in the mixing process of ScHoolboy Q’s album. That shit is coming very very soon,” the team said. “The album sounding fire. This is something big right now. We have been in the studio with my brother every week.”
