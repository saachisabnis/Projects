Doja Cat stripped down to a thong one-piece for a new photo shoot that shows off all of the superstar’s curves.
The Los Angeles native shared the photo set to Instagram in a carousel post on Thursday (April 25), with a caption that simply tagged the photographer and added, “IM TOO FAMOUUUUUUUSSSSSS!”

As she poses on a surf board in a body of water that appears to be in the Coachella valley — where she did her headlining set the prior two weekends — the rapper/singer lets it all hang out.
Among the many admirers in her comments was Kehlani, who wrote, “surfs the fuck up.”
Last week, Doja Cat hit the top of Billboard’s Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart following her headlining performance at Coachella.
On April 17, Billboard reported that her 2023 Scarlet cut “Agora Hills” topped the aforementioned tally dated April 20, following a 19% surge in weekly plays.

This marks the 28-year-old’s first No. 1 on the chart, though she has topped the Pop Airplay chart eight times with hits such as “Say So,” “Kiss Me More” with SZA and more. Previously, her highest position on the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart was No. 8, thanks to the Tyga-assisted “Juicy” back in 2020.
Doja Cat served as the headliner for the third and final night of the annual festival. Throughout her set, the superstar surprised fans with special guests 21 Savage, A$AP Rocky and Teezo Touchdown for their respective collaborations — the last two appear on the deluxe version of her latest LP Scarlet 2: CLAUDE, which was released late last month.

A number of fans thought she was taking shots at her rap peers upon the extended cut’s release, though she was quick to deny the speculation.
“No one has done anything to me for me to even want to begin to diss them. all my peers been nice as fuck and welcoming of me. please stop fucking grasping for straws here,” she wrote.
