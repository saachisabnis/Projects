Glastonbury 2024 was a belter. As usual. With headliners Dua Lipa, Coldplay, and SZA, plus loads and loads more artists including IDLES, Peggy Gou, and Little Simz, thousands of people lucky enough to somehow secure a ticket had an ecstatic five days.  
Whether you were one of those at Worthy Farm and want to relive the experience, or if you watched Glasto on iPlayer through tears wishing you were there, here were the best moments from this year’s bash.

On Friday night, Serbian conceptual artist Marina Abramovic asked the crowd at the Pyramid stage to join her in a seven-minute silence. 
She spoke about wars, famine, and protest, saying, "We can all together give unconditional love to each other. [It's] the only way to change the world". She asked attendees to close their eyes, put a hand on a neighbour's shoulder, and be still and silent for seven minutes straight. 
The Dragonfly was debuted

Glasto's Arcadia area was created for late-night dancing. It used to have a massive fire-breathing spider but this year The Dragonfly replaced it, which Fatboy Slim helped design. It saw sets from Fatboy, Eric Prydz, Andy C, Amelie Lens, Shygirl, and more over the weekend. 
1D’s Louis Tomlinson brought a TV in for the Euros

Glasto didn’t show the England match so Louis Tomlinson, formerly of One Direction, went to Argos to grab one and set it up for punters to watch in a campsite. 
Avril Lavigne FINALLY got her Glasto slot

The pop-punk princess finally performed at Glastonbury after 22 years on the scene. Her set was a hit with many saying she should've been on the Pyramid stage. 70,000 people turned up to Avril's set and the Glasto staff had to stop letting people in because it was so full. Also, Anya Taylor-Joy and Cara Delevigne could be seen bopping along at the side of the stage.

On the Friday, our boy Fred played an unannounced secret set at Strummerville. He played mostly unreleased music as well as tracks from his collaborative album with Brian Eno, Secret Life. 
Kasabian did a “secret” set too

Everyone had heard about their “secret” set before the festival gates had even opened. But still, by the looks of it, it was brilliant. The crowd was clearly well up for it. 
The xx reunited during Jamie xx’s set

Jamie xx was joined by bandmates Romy and Oliver Sim during his Glastonbury set for their first performance together as The xx since 2018. They performed their rendition of 'You Got The Love' and 'Waited All Night' from Jamie’s upcoming album, which features Romy and Sim.
Gillian Anderson, Tom Cruise, and Simon Pegg sang some Oasis before Coldplay came on 
Erm, that’s @TomCruise, Simon Pegg and @GillianA singing Don’t Look Back In Anger by @oasis just before @coldplay come onstage at @glastonbury. pic.twitter.com/vner2CP6c1— Matt Everitt (@matteveritt) June 29, 2024

Simon Pegg jamming out to ‘Don’t Look Back In Anger’ makes sense. But Gillian Anderson and Tom Cruise? All three of them together? An interesting combo but we love it. 
Coldplay headlined for the fifth time and brought out Michael J Fox
Whether you love ‘em or hate ‘em, Coldplay’s set was pretty incredible. The crowd was insanely huge and the light-up wristbands (a regular feature of any Coldplay gig) were a nice touch.
Still, you can’t keep everyone happy

Another unusual collab but we're here for it. Everyone knows this track. It’s brilliant and also fits the Glasto vibe. And we’re sure many people lost their voices screaming along. Tame Impala headline set when? 
And her reaction to a busker with a ukulele went viral

Pop was big this year
Dua wasn’t the only pop artist at this year’s festival that got the crowds collectively losing their sh*t. Sugababes killed it and everyone sang every word, Charli XCX smashed her DJ set, also… 
SEVENTEEN became the first K-pop act to perform on the Pyramid stage

SEVENTEEN were the biggest-selling group in the world last year. They made history by being the first-ever K-pop act to perform on the 53-year-old festival’s main stage. 
Indie and rock had their moments too
While some criticised the lineup for a lack of indie and rock, there was actually a fair amount of it. Two Door Cinema Club in particular had everyone grooving and singing along to their famous guitar riffs. Elsewhere across the weekend, there was The Vaccines, Kasabian (of course), The Breeders, Maruja, Fontaines D.C., Bloc Party, Soft Play, and loads more. 
And IDLES proved rock isn't going anywhere by smashing their headline slot on the Other Stage where…
Banksy launched an art piece

Banksy's no stranger to Glasto, having made the stab-proof vest Stormzy wore during his 2019 headline set. This year, during IDLES’ performance of ‘Danny Nedelko’, Banksy’s piece, an inflatable migrant boat with dummies in it, was seen crowd surfing. Apparently the band didn’t know about it until after their set had finished. 
Simbi killed it, as usual 
Coming through with one of the best Glastonbury sets of 2024, national treasure Little Simz performed some of her many bangers including ‘Gorilla’, ‘Woman’, ‘Venom’, and the debut live performance of ‘Mood Swings’ on the Pyramid stage. She’ll be headlining the Pyramid in a few years and we can’t wait! 
Peggy Gou brought out Sophie Ellis-Bextor 
Fresh off releasing her debut album, I Hear You, Peggy was primed and ready for her Glastonbury set. To make it that bit more special, she brought Sophie out for ‘Murder On The Dancefloor’, and it was gorgeous. 
Keane was praised for their fantastic set

Considered by a fair few attendees as one of the best sets of the weekend, Keane’s singer, Tom Chaplin, was complimented for his near-flawless vocals. And with a handful of songs just about everyone in the UK knows, the crowd belted back every lyric. 
There were loads of flags

Obviously. There was even one that said “Ban flags”. 
And you can see some of the best ones at The Streets’ set
"Who's got the flag?"
Not everyone brought flags though

Surely that’s got to be heavy. 
And here's a bit of The Streets' set because it was fantastic 
Skinner also took a moment to talk about mental health and how “we’re going to feel like crap on Tuesday”. Shout-out to Mike for being vocal about mental health, especially men’s, since day one! 
Glastonbury 2024 was yet another memorable edition. Every year is. There’s just nothing like seeing your favourite artists on stage with your mates by your side.
