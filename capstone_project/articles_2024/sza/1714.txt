With just days to go until the 2024 BRIT Awards, it has been announced that Raye will receive the coveted Songwriter Of The Year prize.
After receiving a record seven nominations, the hitmaker will be in attendance at Saturday's ceremony in London's O2 Arena.
This prestigious prize, introduced in 2022, celebrates exceptional songwriting talent and was decided upon by a select panel of expert judges. Previous winners are Ed Sheeran and Kid Harpoon. 
RAYE will also perform on this year's BRITs, along with Becky Hill X Chase & Status, Calvin Harris & Ellie Goulding, Dua Lipa, Jungle, Kylie Minogue, Rema and Tate McRae.
RAYE commented: 'I am so so honoured and blown away, honestly to be given this prestigious award for Songwriter of the Year, it is my very first BRIT award and I will treasure this trophy very much.

'I am so grateful to be recognised as a songwriter as this is a craft I am so passionate about and have been since I started my journey as a musician, and I'm very grateful to those who voted for me to have this award.'
Damian Christian, Managing Director and President of Promotions at Atlantic Records (part of Warner Music UK) and Chair of the BRIT Committee for 2024 added: 'After receiving a record-breaking seven nominations, I'm delighted that RAYE has also been named Songwriter of the Year. 
'RAYE has been such a prominent and respected songwriter for many years, so it's great to see her getting the recognition she deserves on the biggest stage. 
'I'd like to congratulate her on this win and wish her all the best for Saturday night.'
Raye is the most nominated British female in BRIT Awards history after receiving seven nominations - following the release of her long-awaited debut album, My 21st Century Blues.
Speaking about her BRIT nominations this year, she said the industry considered her 'down and out'.
'It's a miracle, it's deep. Year and a half ago, as far as the industry was concerned, I was down and out and never in my wildest dreams would I feel like trying again and it would lead to seven BRIT nominations.
'I'm a Brit kid, I went to the BRIT's School and this was the goal. The ultimate goal was to find my way somehow to the Brit awards.

'This is a whole different thing. It's a joke. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.'

Announced last year, the winners of this year’s BRITs Rising Star award are The Last Dinner Party, and as confirmed earlier this month, Kylie Minogue will be presented with the BRITs Global Icon award on the night.
