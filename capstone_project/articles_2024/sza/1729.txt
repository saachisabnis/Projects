Halle Bailey has been receiving many accolades during her career, and now, she’s just been announced as an honoree at the upcoming Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards.
According to a press release shared with HipHopDX, the event — which will be hosted by Wu-Tang Clan‘s very own Method Man — will honor the Chloe x Halle chanteuse alongside actress Danielle Brooks, screenwriter Nkechi Okoro Carroll, and STARZ president of original programming Kathryn Busby.

“The intersection of joy and justice is where community thrives,” said Essence Ventures President and CEO, Caroline Wanga, about creating the space to celebrate Black women. “We don’t ever need to diminish our collective power and accomplishments; due to the work we are still doing to exist equitably. The past year tested this intersection within one of our most sacred cultural realms, when the entertainment industry faced the gridlock of stakeholder value and WORTH.
“In parallel, the assets that the industry creates as a direct infusion of joy that propels our community through the depth and breadth of life, were stagnated as a clear and just outcome stayed uncertain. While parts of the incongruence have stabilized, there is still significant work to be done to create sustainable change.”

The comments varied, as might be expected. “I have 2 holes, ima say both,” wrote one commenter, whereas another wrote, “No homo but BOTH and that’s on the dead homies.”

Still another fan thought that LL Cool J was past his prime, but the Wu-Tang Clan breakout star could still get it. “Method Man today …. LL cool J 15 years ago,” wrote one fan. Another fan, however, thinks that Big Elly could still get the business. “LL all day! Bring that buff bald head here, respectfully,” the fan wrote.
