Bringing the heat to the East Coast! Hot Pilates founder Shannon Nadj is taking her celebrity-loved workout to Southampton, New York this summer ahead of the studio's opening in New York City. 
The fitness guru, known for her 95°F heated Pilates classes which A-listers like Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner, SZA, Sofia Richie, Karrueche Tran, Shanina Shaik, Shay Mitchell, and more have all flocked to, sat down with ET to spill everything that's in store.
"We are coming to transform your mind and body. … We love the city and have had so many bicoastal clients over the years, so we look forward to remaining a part of their routine regardless of which coast they are on," the trainer said.
"The Hot Pilates studio energy is second to none. Our experience is unmatched because we invest in immersing our instructors in the Hot Pilates Method," she added. 
As for what New Yorkers can expect: "That Cali heat! … We're packing our infrared heat panels and bringing our incredible Los Angeles-based team to heat things up," Nadj shared.
"We will offer our signature 50-minute Hot Pilates classes, as well as our take on classical reformer Pilates. There will be two experiences in one studio," she continued. 
And if you're looking for a sneak peek of what's to come, RSVP to the Hot Pilates Hamptons Takeover event on Saturday July 27, in partnership with Get Gorgie, Year Of Ours, Hampton Sun, and 100 Coconuts.
"We're going to be working the full body because we never leave a body part at home," the workout expert revealed. 
"We tend to be a little more relaxed during the summer time, so we will really emphasize using the mind-body connection to engage in movement that will release tension while still toning the body."
