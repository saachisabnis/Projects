Lollapalooza doesn’t play around when it comes to their massive genre-hopping lineups.
Year in and year out, the early August festival brings the best in music to Chicago’s Hutchinson Field at Grant Park for four days of rock, punk, Hip-Hop, R&B, K-Pop and more.
The 2024 go-round will be no different. 
This year, the fest, taking place Aug. 1-4, will see R&B icon SZA, indie rock heroes The Killers, K-Pop superstars Stray Kids, pop-punk hitmakers Blink-182 and Hip-Hop headliner Tyler, The Creator in the top spots.
They’ll be joined by Skrillex, Hozier, Future X Metro Boomin, Melanie Martinez, Conan Gray and many, many more.
In total, over 170 (!) acts will grace the Grant Park stages over the long weekend.
And if you can’t wait to get down with all your favorite stars at Lolla, single and multi-day passes can be scooped up as soon as today.
Although inventory isn’t available on Ticketmaster until Thursday, March 21, fans who want to ensure they have tickets ahead of time can purchase on sites like Vivid Seats before tickets are officially on sale.
Vivid Seats is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.
They have a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and will be delivered before the event.
A complete breakdown of all single and multi-day ticket options can be found below.
This year’s poster is eye-popping.
Honestly, we’re just impressed with the graphic designer that fit all the names on a single flier — that’s a feat in and of itself.
