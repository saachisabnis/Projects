Muni Long is not happy about having her music pulled from TikTok by her label’s parent company, Universal Music Group.
The “Made for Me” singer took to TikTok on Wednesday (January 31) to share her thoughts on the matter. In the caption, she suggested that she was in therapy for the record label drama, then revealed in her video that she felt it was some sort of sabotage to her career.

“I mean, it’s not like they are refusing to support my music until I prove that it’s valuable by investing my own money, and maybe, possibly, lucking up on a hot TikTok trend or anything like that,” she wrote, referring to the “Made for Me” challenge that has since gone viral.

Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj and more have seen their music removed from TikTok over the social media network’s dispute with Universal Music Group.
The two companies have failed to agree on a new deal relating to artist compensation and artificial intelligence, which means the music giant can no longer license music to the app.

The deal expired at midnight on Wednesday (January 31) and terms for a new contract have not yet been defined, with UMG saying they will cease to provide music to TikTok after this deadline.
Universal Music Group is one of the biggest record companies in the world with several major labels under its umbrella including Interscope, Republic, and Def Jam.

As a result, the dispute will affect numerous A-list artists including Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj, Eminem, SZA, The Weeknd, and Post Malone.
UMG penned a furious open letter aimed at TikTok which they shared online on Tuesday (January 30).

The conglomerate alleged that the social media platform accounts for “only about 1% of our total revenue”, which they said was evidence of “how little TikTok compensates artists and songwriters, despite its massive and growing user base, rapidly rising advertising revenue and increasing reliance on music-based content”.
UMG also accused TikTok of trying to “intimidate” them by “selectively removing the music of certain of our developing artists” but keeping songs from better-known musicians.

The letter also said: “TikTok’s tactics are obvious: use its platform power to hurt vulnerable artists and try to intimidate us into conceding to a bad deal that undervalues music and shortchanges artists and songwriters as well as their fans.”
As of Thursday (February 1), all videos containing music by UMG artists have been muted.
