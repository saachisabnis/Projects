The Really Good Podcast’s Bobbi Althoff, who rose to fame following the viral success of her interview with Drake, has joined the cast of Colin Jost-produced movie Love Language with Chloe Fineman.
Bobbi Althoff is adding “actress” to her résumé.
The Really Good Podcast host—who rose to fame in 2023 when she interviewed Drake with her signature deadpan sarcasm—is heading to the big screen in the new film Love Language, according to Deadline.
She’ll be joining the cast alongside Saturday Night Live’s Chloe Fineman, The White Lotus’ Lukas Gage and Hamilton’s Anthony Ramos, according to the outlet.
And while the Colin Jost-produced flick will be the podcaster’s first acting job, Bobbi—who shares daughters Luca, 4, and Isla, 2, with ex-husband Cory Althoff—has been vocal about expanding her career beyond just podcasting.
“I just wanted to be successful,” she told Deadline in August. “I was never ever satisfied not doing anything."
Bobbi added that she “always wanted more” than “being a married housewife with nothing.”
“If this fails and I become irrelevant,” she said of her career trajectory, “then you can catch me taking classes at USC.”
Whether Bobbi will find success as an actress remains to be seen, but the 27-year-old—who won the 2024 iHeart Podcast Award for Best Emerging Podcast and recently landed on Forbes’ 30 under 30 list—is no stranger to new frontiers.
“When I started the podcast,” she told Wired in October, “I was like, ‘I don’t know what I’m doing at all, I can’t believe you’re even sitting with me.’”
And once Bobbi began getting into the groove—remarking that “it just slowly happened after I interviewed Drake”—she knew it was time to make a big life change, which included her divorce.
“When my daughter was 3, I remember it was just, ‘If we are going to do this, it needs to be now, because our kids won’t know,’” she continued. “The timing lined up perfectly with me getting a lot of money. Once I knew my career was going to take off, I was okay.”
While waiting for Bobbi’s debut in Love Language, keep reading to see what movies are premiering soon.
