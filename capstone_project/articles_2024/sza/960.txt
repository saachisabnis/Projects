Also in the running for “Best International Artist” were Lana Del Rey, Olivia Rodrigo, Kylie Minogue, Afrobeats superstars Burna Boy and Asake, and Miley Cyrus — who took home the prize for “International Song” with her hit single, “Flowers.”
“Thank you BRITS so much for this award,” the TDE songstress said in a pre-recorded acceptance speech. “Sorry I can’t be there. I’m so grateful for this honor. Thank you for bumping my music. I hear you’re at the O2, which is my favorite. I will always give y’all the best of me and I should be back really soon. Thank you!”
SZA has been checking a number of items off her bucket list in recent months.
Earlier this week, the singer took to social media and re-upped a post from 2017 that read: “HOW DOES ONE GET ON SESAME STREET !?”

In a quote tweet, the 34-year-old revealed that had she made it onto the show seven years later with a photograph of her next to cast members on the set.
In the caption, she wrote: “GODS TIMING !!! FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS AND SAY THEM OUTLOUD !!NEVER GIVE UP !! ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE I BELIEVE IN YOU !!”

On Instagram, she shared a clip next to an Elmo puppet, telling him: “I had the best time, Elmo. Thank you for having me — I can’t wait to come back!” The two then proceeded to share a hug.
The week prior, SZA received seven new gold and platinum certifications for songs released on 2022’s SOS album.

“Open Arms” featuring Travis Scott, “Seek & Destroy” and “Ghost In The Machine” featuring Phoebe Bridgers all reached platinum status for the first time (meaning each cut sold over 1,000,000 equivalent units), whereas “I Hate U” and “Snooze” went three and four times platinum respectively. Most notably, “Good Days” attained 6x platinum status.
Her new BRIT isn’t the only award she earned recently, either.

Back in February, she added “Grammy Award winner” to her biography as she took home three of her nine awards she was nominated for at the 2024 ceremony: Best R&B Song for “Snooze,” Best Progressive R&B Album for SOS and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for “Ghost In The Machine” with Phoebe Bridgers.
