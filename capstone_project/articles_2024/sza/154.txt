"Adding two green bars to my growing list of enemies"
Coach and ticket packages for Glastonbury Festival 2025 sold out in just 32 minutes after going on sale tonight (November 14).
Tickets went on sale at 6pm GMT with fans hoping to attend the UK’s biggest festival from June 25 to 29 next year.
See Tickets announced after 25 minutes that Wednesday coach tickets had sold out, while 32 minutes after the sale began, the festival announced on social media: “The Glastonbury 2025 tickets + coach travel which were on sale this evening have now all been sold. Our thanks to everyone who bought one.”
They didn’t sell out as quickly as they did last year, however, when coach tickets sold out in just 25 minutes.
Particularly with 2026 set to be a fallow year for the festival, fans have been hoping to get their hands on tickets, but not all were successful this evening.
Check out some reactions from those trying to get tickets below:

For 2025, Glastonbury has introduced a new queuing system for tickets, meaning that rather than needing to keep refreshing to access the booking page, everyone on the page was randomly assigned a palace in a queue once sales began.
Glastonbury bosses confirmed on the festival’s website: “Anyone who logs on once the sale has started will automatically be added to the back of the queue, so it’s important to make sure you are online ready at least a few minutes before the sale opens.”
Reaction to the new queueing system was mixed, one hopeful attendee describing it as “my new enemy,” and another saying, “Being in a queue for Glastonbury tickets is so boring what happened to manically refreshing the page every five seconds.”

Rather than being shown a number indicating their place in the queue, it appeared that people could keep track of their progress through a grey bar on their screen – the further along the queue, the more green blocks appear over the bar.
One fan in the queue wrote, “Adding two green bars to my growing list of enemies,” while another put it, “No queue number is bollocks.”

I reckon there's a good number in this queue just seeing what the new system is like ahead of Sunday's main sale. They have no intention to go by coach.😂 #Glastonbury

General tickets will go on sale at 6pm GMT on Sunday November 17, and will be sold exclusively here. Tickets will be £373.50 plus a £5 booking fee, an increase of £18.50 from 2024, with coach and ticket bundles costing more depending on the destination you’re travelling from.
You’ll need to pay a £75 deposit when purchasing tickets, with the remaining balance payable on the first week of April next year. National Express coaches will offer coach travel to standard ticket holders.
For those unable to secure tickets this week, re-sale tickets are usually made available in the spring. However, these tend to sell out quickly, too, with coach and ticket re-sale bundles selling out in just 18 minutes and general re-sale tickets selling out in 22 minutes this year.
In 2023, coach tickets sold out in 22 minutes with main tickets selling out in an hour, and re-sale tickets selling out in just six minutes. The previous year, re-sale tickets sold out in 20.
To be in with a chance of securing tickets, you need to register with contact details and a passport-style photo, though registration for this week’s batch of tickets closed on Monday November 11. Glastonbury has also introduced Google and Apple Pay payments for the first time this year.
2024’s festival saw Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA headlining, with other memorable sets from the likes of Shania Twain, Little Simz, Fontaines D.C. and IDLES. The line-up for 2025 is still under wraps – though co-organiser Emily Eavis confirmed at the end of this year’s festival that she was “already in talks” with some acts – but among the rumoured headliners are Olivia Rodrigo – who’s in the UK on June 27 for a BST Hyde Park headline show – The Rolling Stones, Green Day – announced to be headlining Download earlier in June – and AC/DC.
Others mooted include Harry Styles, Raye, Taylor Swift – who was set to headline in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic caused the festival’s cancellation – and Eminem.
Oasis had been rumoured following their announcement of a reunion tour for next year, but they confirmed that they won’t be playing festivals next year with with frontman Liam Gallagher calling Glastonbury “full of drips” in a tweet last month.
Meanwhile, Eavis addressed criticism over a perceived lack of rock acts on the festival’s main stages this year, saying: “I think the line-up reflects what’s happening in the music world at the moment – there aren’t a lot of new rock acts to choose from if I’m honest. Hopefully that will emerge again, my heyday was 1995 with Pulp and Oasis and Radiohead – and that was great, but music changes all the time and right now this is where we’re at.
“Every year, we’ve been criticised for being too rock, too grime, too hip hop, too pop – it’s just part of our year. Generally, it’s not from the public – everybody’s really happy and excited to be here.”
