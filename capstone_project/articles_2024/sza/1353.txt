“Made In America will not take place in 2024,” the statement read. “Since its inception, this groundbreaking festival has celebrated music & community — from creating a space for fans to connect, to uplifting local small businesses & shining a light on important causes. It has strived for accessibility, eliminating barriers through affordable tickets and location.”
It continued: “As purveyors of change, the Made In America executive production team is reimagining a live music experience that affirms our love and dedication to music and the work we do. We promise an exciting return to the festival.”
Last year’s festival was canceled just weeks before it was scheduled to take place due to “severe circumstances outside of production control.”
While no stars were announced for the 2024 iteration, a stacked list of names had been unveiled for the axed 2023 festival including SZA, Ice Spice, Metro Boomin, Lizzo and Tems.

Cam’ron and Ma$e were also set to reunite for a “special joint set.”
Made in America last took place in 2022 and was headlined by Tyler, The Creator and Bad Bunny, with performances also coming from the likes of Pusha T, Kodak Black and Lil Uzi Vert.
