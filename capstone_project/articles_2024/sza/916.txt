Muni Long’s “Made for Me” asserts its place atop the R&B radio game as it rises to No. 1 on Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart dated April 6. 

	The single ascends from the runner-up spot after a 3% gain to 21.6 million in audience that made it the most-heard song on U.S. monitored adult R&B and mainstream R&B/hip-hop radio stations in the March 22 – 28 tracking week, according to Luminate.

	The new champ gives Muni Long her second No. 1 on R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay, after the eight-week ruler “Hrs and Hrs,” in 2022. While that song raced to the top in 12 weeks, Muni Long’s second coronation took considerably longer – 26 frames. Having debuted on the chart dated Oct. 19, 2023, “Made for Me” wraps the seventh-longest trek to the summit among the chart’s 303 leaders.

	Here’s a review of the songs that needed the most weeks to top the R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart, dating to its 1992 launch:

Weeks to No. 1, Song Title, Artist, Date Reached No. 135, “Step in the Name of Love,” R. Kelly, Dec. 6, 200333, “Free Mind,” Tems, Nov. 12, 202231, “You,” Lloyd featuring Lil Wayne, Feb. 17, 200729, “There Goes My Baby,” Aug. 14, 201029, “Snap Yo Fingers,” Lil Jon featuring E-40 & Sean Paul of the YoungBloodz, July 29, 200629, “I Wanna Know,” Joe, April 1, 200026, “Made for Me,” Muni Long, April 6, 2024

	“Made for Me” takes the throne from SZA’s “Snooze,” which pauses its No. 1 domination after a record-breaking 36 nonconsecutive weeks on charge, but remains virtually even in radio airplay compared to the prior week. But don’t count the juggernaut out just yet: During its historic run, “Snooze” was bounced twice from the top spot – two weeks each for Usher, Summer Walker and 21 Savage’s “Good Good” and Victoria Monet’s “On My Mama” – but recovered each time.

	Steady support from both adult R&B and mainstream R&B/hip-hop stations give “Made for Me” enough radio audience to manage the win. It adds a third week atop the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart even with a 5% decline in plays for the week. On Adult R&B Airplay, despite having peaked at No. 2 in December, the track remains in high rotation, improving 6-5 on the latest chart, essentially remaining even in plays during the last tracking week compared to the prior frame. The consistency dates to the single’s second wind following viral buzz on TikTok for clips based on its “twin, where have you been?” lyric.

	










	Elsewhere, the tune climbs on Rhythmic Airplay, with a 10-7 boost after a 22% surge in weekly plays at the format. Coupled with strong results on the R&B/hip-hop side, the gains help “Made for Me” push 18-14 on the all-genre Radio Songs chart. There, the hit added 10% in audience to reach 33.5 million for the week across all genre formats.
