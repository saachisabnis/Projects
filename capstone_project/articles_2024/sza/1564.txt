On Lana, SZA is back in her longing back. Specifically, on the buzzily titled “Scorsese Baby Daddy,” she’s waiting for … well, a Scorsese baby daddy. “I could’ve called my mom up / I’d rather fuck about it,” SZA croons. “Addicted to the drama / Scorsese baby daddy.” Excuse us? In the next verse, SZA explains that she’s looking for the sort of volatile relationship that Martin Scorsese’s mobsters, criminals, and rich guys often have. “I would pretend to do my favorite man, he’d call me tasty,” she sings. “Furious lady, then I wonder if I could do, baby / One day, I’ll understand all that it takes to be a lady.”
Okay, but what kind of Scorsese baby daddy are we talking? (And before you call her a fake fan, she’s met the guy.) Is SZA looking for a bad-boy gangster like Goodfellas’s Jimmy Conway or Gangs of New York’s Amsterdam Vallon? Or a debauched criminal millionaire like The Wolf of Wall Street’s Jordan Belfort? Or maybe even a devoted Jesuit priest like Sebastião or Francisco in Silence? (Hey, if he looks like Andrew Garfield or Adam Driver!) Surely, she doesn’t mean Scorsese himself, who’s been married to his wife, Helen, since 1999. But whichever Scorsese baby daddy she finds might wanna listen to her Tarantino-inspired hit “Kill Bill” first.
