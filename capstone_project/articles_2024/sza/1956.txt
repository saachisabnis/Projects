It was Raye's night at the BRIT Awards as the emotional My 21st Century Blues star received a record tally of wins.
The singer-songwriter picked up a whopping six awards at the annual music event at The O2 Arena in London on Saturday night and was in tears as she took to the stage to collect her final award of the evening. She told the audience: "You just don't understand what this means to me."
Among her record-breaking wins were Artist of the Year and Album Of The Year for My 21st Century Blues. The star, who had already made history by being nominated in seven categories, thanked her producer Mike Sabath and her grandmother Agatha Dawson-Amoah, who accompanied her onto stage and who Raye said had been up until 3am "praying for her".
As Raye, who turned independent in 2021 and whose track Escapism went viral on TikTok last year, is enjoying the spotlight, a resurfaced tweet from May 2020 saw the now-26-year-old share her hopes of one day winning a Brit. She had written: "Since I was 14 years old, I have dreamed of winning a Brit award. I'm praying one day i get lucky enough and I can quote tweet this tweet with a picture of this moment. @BRITs."
The  BRIT Awards ceremony was a big night for other artists ranging from Jungle who won their first BRIT for Group of the Year to Miley Cyrus who won best International Song for Flowers. And the night's performers rocked too with Kylie Minogue, Dua Lipa - both of them also winners - and Tate McRae among those performing live.
