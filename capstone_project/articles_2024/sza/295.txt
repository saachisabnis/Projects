Following the 2025 Grammys, let's take a look at some Grammy history.
The 2025 Grammys saw epic performances from our faves including Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter and Doechii. Beyoncé took home Album Of The Year in a history making evening where she also took home the Grammy for Best Country Album, both for 'Cowboy Carter'.
The show saw Taylor Swift give a sweet nod to her boyfriend Travis Kelce, and somewhere in the crowd Sabrina and Olivia Rodrigo put the feud rumours to bed once and for all. 
While Billie and Taylor surprisingly didn't take home any awards at the 67th annual show, it saw Sabrina earn her first two Grammys.
So, now we have a whole year to wait until the next one, here's who currently holds the top spot for the most Grammys wins ever...
Beyoncé holds the top spot for the most Grammy wins.
She has 35 total Grammy wins and a whopping 99 nominations. 
At the 67th annual Grammys in 2025 she became the first black woman in 26 years to win Album Of The Year - an award the industry has been waiting for her to win forever. The same year she won Best Country Album, both for 'Cowboy Carter'.
In 2025 she also took home Best Country Duo/Group Performance with Miley Cyrus for 'II Most Wanted'.
At the 66th annual Grammys in 2024 she had no nominations but the previous year, in 2023, she took home four trophies which first landed her the title of the artist with the most Grammy wins ever.
Closely behind the 'Plastic Off The Sofa' singer is Hungarian-British conductor Georg Solti who has 31 Grammy wins! 
According to the Record Academy the late conductor Georg doesn't only hold the record for the most Grammy Awards won in any genre with 31, he also has the most wins in the Classical Field.
American record producer Quincy's work spans across more than 10 Fields, from Children's to Jazz, Pop, Rap, R&B, and more. 
He is one of only 15 artists to receive the Grammy Legend Award.
Alison is a top GRAMMY winner and holds the spot for the female with the most awards in the Country Field.
Tied with Alison and making it in the top 5 is musician and composer Chick who has won all of his awards in the Jazz Field.

Another name you'll recognise on the list of artists with the most wins would be Beyoncé's husband Jay-Z, who was joint with Kanye West for the most Grammy wins by a rap artist at 24 Grammy wins. This all changed in 2025.
Due to his work on Beyoncé's 'Cowboy Carter', Jay-Z's epic Grammy nominations total went up to 89 and his total wins rose to 25.
