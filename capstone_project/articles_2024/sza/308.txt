Inglewood-based Jean Dawson straddles multiple cultures and gives voice to fans who see themselves in his work. His distinctive sound has been noticed by artists like SZA and A$AP Rocky. Another notable collaborator is Lil Yachty, who you’ll hear on the track “Die For Me,” which will be featured on Dawson’s forthcoming album Glimmer of God out in October.
