SZA threatened to walk off stage during an Australian performance, on Tuesday night, after rowdy fans allegedly threw their phones at the Grammy winning R&B artist.
The "Kill Bill" singer, who was appearing in Melbourne, warned spectators, while holding up an object that was reportedly thrown at her from the crowd.
"I will leave," she said in a video obtained by the Daily Mail. "Do not throw up any cell phones, I'm a person. That's crazy."

  The incident occurred during the first show of the Melbourne leg of SZA's SOS Tour. The artist previously performed in Sydney and Brisbane and had two additional tour dates scheduled in Melbourne.  SZA remained on stage for the rest of this evening while some fans on social media complained about audience behavior on social media. In addition to the reports of audience members throwing objects on stage, one attendee also posted a video to TikTok alleging that fans misbehaved throughout the evening.
"Sad that Melbourne will forever be SZA's least favorite destination due to the pitiful behavior from people in the [general admission] crowd at the end of the show," TikTok user Sam Liu wrote. "The overwhelming posters, selfish 'pick me' flyers - ridiculous, attention-seeking activity."
SZA - whose real name is Solana Rowe - is an American singer-songwriter. Her 2022 album "SOS" was nominated for nine Grammys and won three.
