A few months after he took the music industry by storm, 4batz has finally released his debut mixtape. On Friday, May 3, the versatile artist delivered his first official project u made me a st4r via gamma. The 11-track album begins with a reflection on all the fame he quickly garnered after he made his debut last year. It continues with his first three viral singles "act i: stickerz '99'," "act ii: date @ 8," and "act iii: on god? (she like)." The rest of the mixtape features acts iv through viii and ends with Kanye West's remix of "act iii: on god? (she like)." 
Ye was one of the first major artists to co-sign the Dallas native earlier this year after his first two singles went viral. In addition to Ye, other crooners like Ty Dolla $ign and SZA also thought his music was fire. Prior to the release of his mixtape, 4batz received praise from Drake. The 20-year-old artist got an opportunity to link up with Drizzy after he hopped on the remix to "act ii: date @ 8." "Honestly, it came about with me just hearing all the toxicity in today's music," 4Batz told iHeartRadio about his recent record. "Really trying to show the females that men can be vulnerable too and they also can take care of you."Unfortunately, 4batz and Drake's collaboration didn't make it on the final version of the album. There's still hope that it will appear on an upcoming deluxe edition, but there's no word on when that will arrive. For now, listen to 4batz's debut mixtape below. WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE
