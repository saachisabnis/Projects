	“Good Luck, Babe!” is featured on Roan’s debut album, Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, which dropped in September 2023. The track, written in collaboration with Daniel Nigro and Justin Tranter, peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and earned Roan her first No. 1 on Billboard’s Pop Airplay chart in September 2024.

	Roan reflected on the journey behind “Good Luck, Babe!” in an interview with Rolling Stone. “I just wanted to write a big anthemic pop song,” she said. “The song was a b—- to write,” the singer-songwriter added, explaining that it’s “about wishing good luck to someone who’s denying fate.”

	This year has been a whirlwind for Roan. She’s garnered six Grammy nominations for 2025, including best new artist. Her Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess is nominated for both album of the year and best pop vocal album, while “Good Luck, Babe!” earned nods for song of the year, record of the year and best pop solo performance.

	The Spotify news arrives just days after Franz Ferdinand gave their own take on “Good Luck, Babe!” during a BBC Radio 2 performance. “It’s just an amazing song by an incredible artist,” lead singer Alex Kapranos said. “Some artists have a moment, and it’s often divisive. But I’ve yet to meet anyone who doesn’t love Chappell. This song is incredible, and we’re thrilled to play it.”
