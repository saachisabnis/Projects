Europe
Europe
From Alpine jazz weekends and remote island destinations to headliner-packed fests, this is where we’ll be booking this year
Europe is incredible for festivals, make no mistake about it. And what could be better? Travelling to festivals abroad means getting to explore somewhere new and see a bunch of cracking artists, as well as maybe – just maybe – enjoy better weather and cheaper beer. Europe is certainly not in short supply of some really brilliant places to party, from tiny, lesser-known spots in the Azores to your classic, mega, headliner-packed fests in France and Netherlands and Alpine jazz weekends. So, here’s a roundup of our top picks for 2025. 
Glastonbury festival in the UK is normally thought of as the biggest festival in Europe (if not the world). But though it’s certainly the most well known, in terms of numbers, it’s not even the the biggest in the UK! The biggest in Europe is actually Donauinselfest in Vienna, Austria, which sees upwards of two million visitors a year. After that, it’s probably joint between Glasto and Tomorrowland in Belgium.

Over the past two decades, no festival has consolidated its place amongst Europe’s very best quite like the Barcelona edition of Primavera Sound. Renowned for a marvellously broad line-up that features as many hot-shot newcomers as proper, established legends, it’s all impeccably well-organised. And it’s in a remarkable waterfront location, the Parc del Forum, which is both inside Barcelona itself and a place that seems purpose-built for a continent-leading music festival. Be sure to check out the Primavera in Porto, too.
Big names: Charli XCX, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan 
Where: Parc del Forum, Barcelona, Spain
When: June 5 - 7, 2025

No list of the best music fests in Europe (or the world, for that matter) is complete without Glastonbury. After a big ol’ ticketing debacle back in November, this year’s line-up is still under wraps, but when has the roster not been an absolute treasure trove? Whether you’re chanting along with the masses at the glitzy Pyramid Stage or worming your way into one of the countless hidden zones and legendary secret sets, a few hours at Glasto and you’ll soon know exactly why the ginormous fest sells out so ridiculously quickly every year.
Rumoured big names: The lineup for 2025 is still TBC, but rumours include Eminem, Rihanna and Madonna. Rod Stewart and Neil Young have both been confirmed as headliners. 
Where: Glastonbury, Somerset, UK
When: June 25 - 29, 2025

As if being out on São Miguel island in the Azores – i.e. out in the middle of the Atlantic, about 1,400 kilometres off the coast of mainland Portugal – wasn’t adventurous enough, Tremor turns the entire music festival experience into a sort of quest. Performances are at secret locations dotted throughout the island, some reached by raft and/or jungle trek. The music leans towards all things experimental, from folk and punk to electronics, while the limited number of tickets ensures it all remains shrouded in tantalising mystery.
Big names: DJ Giovanna, The Zenmenn, Keeley Forsyth
Where: São Miguel, Azores
When: April 8 - 12, 2025
The Montreux Jazz Festival has been drawing legends of jazz (and jazz-adjacent music) to the shores of Lake Geneva since all the way back in 1967. Over the past half-century everyone from Miles Davis and Bill Evans to Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone and Frank Zappa has graced the fest – and these days the line-up is more star-studded and varied than ever. Classic rock, modern soul and fiery hip-hop often feature – as well as, obviously, plenty of jazz.
Big names: TBC for 2025
Where: Lake Geneva, Switzerland
When: July 4 - 19, 2025
📍 Discover the best things to do in Geneva
Arguably the coolest festival in Barcelona’s summer calendar, Sónar celebrates the intersection of art, music and technology. It's back for its 32rd year with an ecletic lineup of global artists that transcends sonic borders. Sónar Week runs for a full six days, from June 10-15, transforming the city into an international hub of electronic music and culture, through collaborations and co-productions with the city’s leading promoters and institutions. This includes partnerships with +RAIN Film Festival, OFFSónar and the main event, Sónar 2025. 
Big names: Arca, BICEP present CHROMA AV/DJ set, Honey Dijon, Four Tet, MOCHAKK, Skrillex b2b Blawan, Overmono, Pa Salieu, Peggy Gou.
Where: Barcelona, Spain
When: June 12 - 14, 2025
This remote disco festival, a homage to the likes of Studio 54 and Paradise Garage, is totally unique. Detour Discotheque changes location each time, rocking up in Iceland in 2022, Scotland in 2023, and Switzerland last year. In 2025 it’s coming to a masseria (basically a big, fancy farmhouse) in Puglia, already a dreamy location for a Mediterranean getaway. Only 300 people can attend, but the intimate vibe makes it all the more enjoyable – the cult event is known for its inclusivity, especially for the LGBTQ community. 
Big names: TBC, but so far DJ Daisybelle, Manchester disco collective Talking Drums, Naples-based Italo disco DJ and producer Whodamanny are confirmed 
Where: Puglia, Italy
When: September 19 - 21, 2025
📍 Discover the most underrated places to visit in Italy
Croatia (and much of the Adriatic coast in general, for that matter) has become a dance music hotspot in recent years. As ideal for boogieing ‘til sunrise (and long after) and blissing out in the daytime as it is for secret island parties, festivals from Dimensions to Defected have shown just how to make the most of this spectacular setting. Our pick of the bunch is Love International, which consistently boasts the best line-ups of any of ‘em. 
Big names: Ellie Stokes, Objekt, Mad Professor 
Where: The Garden Tisno, Croatia
When: July 9 - 15, 2025
For years, Polish festival Open’er has confounded with the quality of its line-up. From 2023’s Kendrick Lamar headline slot and 2024’s storming Dua Lipa set to the return of LCD Soundsystem in 2016, each year it seems to dig out a staggering number of huge names. Oh, and it’s all on an abandoned airstrip near the Polish resort town of Gdynia. So far as festival set-ups go, Open’er is as dramatic and very, very cool as it gets.
Big names: FKA Twigs, Linkin Park, Raye, St. Vincent
Where: Gdynia-Kosakowo Airport, Gdynia, Poland.
When: July 2 - 5, 2025
A fan of all kinds of music – and we really mean all kinds of music? Rewire is the festival for you. Priding itself on the enormous range of music on offer, since being founded in 2012 Rewire has put on a programme of avant-garde jazz, industrial rock, ambient pop, orchestral minimalism and much, much more to The Hague. If you’re an adventurous music listener, it’s essential.
Big names: Backxwash, emma dj, Good Sad Happy Sad
Where: The Hague, Netherlands
When: 3 - 6 April, 2025
With all its gardens, fountains and sculptures, the Domaine Nationale de Saint-Cloud near Paris is a mind-bogglingly gorgeous place to visit. But when combined with a music festival at Rock en Seine, it becomes a very special venue indeed. Despite the name, Rock en Seine offers up much more than yer typical guitar-bass-‘n’-drums acts. Over the years ReS has branched out into hip-hop, metal, electronica and all-out chart pop, firmly establishing its place as France’s premier music fest.
Big names: There’s something for everyone here with headliners including A$AP Rocky, Queens of The Stone Age, Jamie XX, Vampire Weekend, Kneecap, Doechii, Fontaines D.C., Stereophonics, and an opening night performance from none other than pop princess Chappell Roan.
Where: Saint-Cloud, near Paris 
When: August 20 - 24, 2025
Legendary electronic fest Dekmantel is all about pushing beyond the limits of electronic music, offering everything from pounding techno and house beats to ambient space-outs and cosmic jazz. Held riverside on the IJ in the leafy southern Amsterdam suburb of Amstelveen, Dekmantel is as apt for interrogating the potential of electronica as it is for a mad dance sesh.
Big names: Avalon Emerson, British Murder Boys, Yaeji, and Honey Dijon
Where: Amstelveen, Amsterdam, Netherlands
When: July 30 - August 3, 2025
Designed to be a blend of beach holiday and music festival, Kala promises to be a dreamy affair. It’s been praised as a bit of a hidden gem on the festival circuit, full of exclusive parties and open air beach stages. By day, you can swim in the crystal clear sea, take a hike, go on a boat trip, or even get some spa treatments. At night, vibe out to any one of dozens of banging DJ sets, then sleep everything off at a hotel included in your ticket price. 
Big names: Ezra Collective are headlining, with Kelly Lee Owens and Myd also appearing, and Theo Parrish and Nicolas Lutz on the decks
Where: Dhërmi, on the Albanian Riviera

Exit Festival in the Serbian city of Novi Sad was founded as a pro-democracy student protest movement all the way back in 2000, and while it remains known for its social activism, these days it’s just as renowned for its sprawling line-ups and innovative range of extra stuff. Housed in the hilltop Petrovaradin Fortress, alongside Exit’s 16 stages are sports zones, chill-out areas and even a zipline.
Big names: Gucci Mane, Black Eyed Peas, Rudimental
Where: Petrovaradin Fortress, Novi Sad, Serbia
When: July 10 - 13, 2025
Take a look at the line-up of G! Festival and, unless you’re Danish or Faroese, you’ll likely be left pretty baffled. This fest on the Faroe Island of Eysturoy prides itself on its local and Danish talent – and while that talent sure is brilliant, it’s the setting that truly dazzles. With stages built on the beach and a local football pitch, the horizon is dominated by the Faroes’ dramatic grass-carpeted mountains. And as if it couldn’t get any better, there are saunas and hot tubs on the beach, too.
Big names: Marius, DC, Hallur Joensen
Where: Göta, Eysturoy, Faroe Islands
When: July 17 - 19, 2025
C2C has been holding raucous avant-pop parties in Turin’s most fabulous industrial spaces for just over 20 years – and they ain’t slowing down any time soon. Originally standing for ‘Club to Club’ (and not to be confused with the country festival of the same name), C2C takes over the likes of Fiat’s towering old production factory in Lingotto and a grand nineteenth-century train repair centre. It remains a fascinating display of artists exploring the various ways that pop music warps, twists and thrills.
Big names: Blood Orange, AG Cook, Four Tet, Skee Mask.
Where: Turin, Italy
When: October 30 - Nov 2, 2025
Dorset’s End of the Road might be tiny, but it packs a heck of a punch. The focus here is keeping things small but making sure every inch of it is as great as it can be, from the limited but carefully curated line-up (which usually centres around indie folk and rock) to the craft beer vans and the walking trails that wind through the woodland. It’s all just so thoroughly, thoroughly lovely.
Big names: Self Esteem, Father John Misty, Caribou, Viagra Boys and Black Country, New Road
Where: Larmer Tree Gardens, Dorset, England
When: August 28 - 31, 2025
Considering it has just two stages, Paredes de Coura boasts a lot of quality into its small-ish line-up. Taking place in a valley outside Porto, PdC has been running for nearly three decades and is a rite of passage for Portuguese teenagers. And it’s hard to disagree that this place simply has to be experienced. Not only does the natural amphitheatre provide a spectacular setting, but if you’re flagging you can get yourself a raft and doze off as you float down the river at the valley bottom.
Big names: Franz Ferdinand, Jersey, Ana Frango Elétrico
Where: Paredes de Coura, Portugal
When: August 13 - 16, 2025
Pop, rock and electronic artists fill the roster at this festival on the Valencian coast, but there are of course lots of quirky, arty displays to be discovered too. With FIB’s schedule not kicking off until early evening, this festival bears the Spanish summer heat in mind, so you needn’t worry about endless hours in the scorching weather. In fact, spend it at the beach instead. This Fest has two campsites – Campfest or the slightly more comfortable Villacamp – which are both just a stroll away from the resort’s seafront. Sunbathe, boogie, sleep, repeat. 
Big names: Bloc Party, the Black Keys, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Olly Alexander, Residente and more
Where: 12560 Benicàssim, Castellón, Spain
When: July 17 - 19, 2025
📍 Discover the best places to visit in Spain
Often described as more of a Danish national holiday than just a festival, Denmark’s flagship music festival Roskilde is a titanic cultural event. Combining huge-name headliners with on-the-pulse newcomers and tonnes of installations and performance art, the bill is diverse, vast and caters to an enormous range of music listeners. Plus, it’s all combined with a typically Scandi style of camping and organisation, meaning it’s a little comfier, cleaner and better-equipped than most.  
Big names: Olivia Rodrigo, Stormzy, Jamie XX, Fontaines D.C.
Where: Roskilde, Denmark
When: June 28 - July 5, 2025
How much music can you squeeze into one island in the middle of the Danube? A heck of a lot, it turns out. Sziget, which is on leafy Óbudai-sziget island in Budapest, crams literally thousands of performances (and 60 stages) into its programme and consistently churns out some of the biggest names in world pop music. Each year Sziget somehow manages to get bigger and better, adding party boats, amusement parks and even immersive chill-out domes.  
Big names: Post Malone, ASAP Rocky, Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, Shawn Mendes
Where: Óbudai-sziget, Budapest, Hungary
When: August 6 - 11, 2025
📍 Discover the best things to do in Budapest
Tomorrowland is swarmed by bass-drop-obsessed brosteppers and glitter-doused influencers – but even if you’re neither of those things, there’s so much to admire in this legendary Belgian fest. Tomorrowland’s OG event (near the town of Boom, naturally) has achieved a sort of mythical status – and, thanks to its hundreds of DJs, immersive festival themes, gargantuan scale and eye-bulgingingly OTT stage design, it’s not hard to see why.
Big names: Swedish House Mafia, David Guetta, Martin Garrix, Jax Jones, John Newman, Joy Orbison, Steve Aoki, Sigala
Where: Provinciaal Recreatiedomein De Schorre, Boom, Belgium
When: July 18 - 20 and 25 - 27, 2025
Everyone knows that dub and reggae are best heard on the biggest, loudest, bassiest sound systems possible – and few places get that vibe so clearly as International Dub Gathering in Tarragona, Spain. Fuelled by artists from around the world, IDG may well be the finest and most glorious celebration of dub, reggae and sound system culture outside of Jamaica and the Caribbean.
Big names: King Earthquake, Quantic, Greenlight
Where: L’Aldea, Tarragona, Spain
When: June 19 - 22, 2025
