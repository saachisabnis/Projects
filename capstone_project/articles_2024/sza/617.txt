Jack Harlow is starting a new music festival in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky — and he's headlining the first event himself this spring. Gazebo Festival is set for May 25th and 26th at the city’s Waterfront Park, and also features SZA as a headliner along with performances by Vince Staples, Omar Apollo, Pinkpantheress, Majid Jordan, a DJ set from James Blake, and more.
Tickets go on sale next Friday, March 8th and a portion of every sale will benefit the Jack Harlow Foundation, which works to “reinvest, uplift, and support organizations” in Louisville.
“Jack Harlow is an extraordinary Louisvillian who continues to give back to his hometown,” says Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. “This is yet another way Jack is showing up for our city and I can’t wait to see the excitement this festival creates. I am so grateful for his commitment to making first class things happen for Louisville and our people.”
