Childish Gambino may be one of the most in-demand men in entertainment, but there are only a select few that belong in his inner circle — on Instagram, at least.
The rapper and actor born Donald Glover took to his Instagram Stories on Wednesday (July 3) to share a screen capture of the people he includes in his “Close Friends” list.

The exclusive list includes his longtime collaborator and producer Ludwig Göransson, as well as Chloe Bailey, who starred in his TV series Swarm.
Other people with access to Glover’s “Close Friends” content include genre-bending singer Fousheé, who initially rose to fame by performing a cover of Gambino’s “Redbone” on The Voice, and producer Michael Uzowuru, who in addition to credits for Frank Ocean, SZA and Vince Staples created the score and co-produced the soundtrack for Swarm.
Childish Gambino has been noticeably more active on social media of late as he gears up to release his new movie and album, Bando Stone & The New World.
The multi-hyphenate shared the trailer for the film last month, which shows him playing a fictional pop star named Bando Stone who must navigate a post-apocalyptic world, despite his only talent being singing.

The creepy yet comedic trailer shows Glover’s character banding together with fellow survivors to make their way to safety, only to encounter giant blood-thirsty creatures, electromagnetic traps and other surreal, potentially extraterrestrial threats.
“What are you when the world ends?” a sobering question is posed to viewers in the trailer.

Following the release of Bando Stone & The New World, Gambino will embark on a massive international tour taking him across North America, Europe and Oceania between August 2024 and February 2025.
He’ll be joined on the road by fellow genre-bending stars Willow Smith and Amaarae.
