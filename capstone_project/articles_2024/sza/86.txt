Home    Forums    Music    Kendrick Lamar new album “GNX”
I liked GNX. Has anyone posted Kendrick Lamar’s submission predictions yet? Am I the only one who thinks “luther” is likely going R&B or Pop Duo/Group?
I could see it in Melodic Rap.

My wishful set list for Kendrick’s Super Bowl:
– Bad Blood hook intro —
1. Not Like Us / TV Off (with a stadium band) – 90s
2. Backseat Freestyle / Like That – 90s
3. Maad City / DNA – 90s
4. Family Ties (with Baby Keem) – 90s
5. Alright / Reincarnated (with a pianist) – 60s
6. N95 / Squabble Up – 90s
7. King Kunta – 60s
8. All The Stars (with SZA) – 60s
9. Luther / Love (with SZA) – 90s
10. Drank / Money Trees – 90s
11. Humble – 90s 
N/B: I wish Tyler, The Creator would join onstage to play the piano for Reincarnated. I’ll cry like little boy, I mean (waaahhhh, sniff, sniff, waaah). Damn, I love that song.
Kendrick is a great live performer so I expect to enjoy the show whichever way. Might end up going in-person!
Time heals everything…don’t end it…wait it out.

This is a good set list but he already performed Alright and Humble at his previous Super Bowl performance so i’m expecting him to leave those two out.

Even Maad City 😭, so I imagined Maad City & Alright as mashups with other tracks.

we need Bad Blood! 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

“HUMBLE.” was not performed that year. Only “Alright” and “M.A.A.D. City” were performed.
we need Bad Blood! 
I fixed it somewhere, just for you.

No
Chromakopia is definitely better than GNX to me. GNX is more lyrical but its production is vanilla, no thanks to Jack. 
Why? Because of the weird haircut, mask and random uniform? Aesthetic doesn’t mean quality.

Chromakopia has a rich & unique sound, with a strong theme. Everything is symbolic. 
Tyler’s music has always referenced his dad (whom he thought left him), which was turning into obsession, always calling the man “Nigerian Fuck” in his songs.
Well, Chromakopia explored Tyler himself, liberated from all that. “Like Him” explains the obsession; his mum always told him he looked exactly like his dad, and ends with a voice note from her, explaining that his dad never left, she took him and left against his efforts. Dad was tracked 2yrs ago, after CMIYGL. 
The Chromakopia uniform is the old Nigerian military uniform, used around the time his dad was born in the era of military dictatorship. 
I question the next theories since they don’t come from him, but some rumoured that:
(His dad wanted to use his mum (Black American) for immigration at that time, because of the airplane in the aesthetics.) 
(The mask allegedly implies the lack of empathy in that, and the hair partition represents ambivalence on the matter.) 
(St. Chroma alter ego means colour purity and embracing his dad’s last name on-stage, Okonma (meaning “Good Man” in Igbo).)
Tyler is artsy, not weird.

Explains your sudden love for Tyler LMFAO.

Silence yourself Jamie.
If so, why do I ignore Cynthia Erivo, Shabozey and the host of others who share my ethnicity? Shouldn’t I have hated Tyler for his long-lasting dislike for Nigerians? Why do I interact more with GD users of distant backgrounds, compared to others here? 
I liked Kanye, Kendrick & Tyler for their eccentricities. Kanye came, Kendrick improved on Kanye, now Tyler is building upon Kendrick. 
There’s simply no context to talk about them much because GD leans towards female artists. However, I have the right to be excited when they smash too.

Any way, logging off GD now. FYI: I won’t be back for a really long time, in case I don’t respond/react to follow-ups on pending talks, it’s not me airing anyone. I’ve chatted with many users for over 8yrs now, like since uni, so I’m now attached and will miss you all Ofc, CIAO!

Wait first, hope everything is alright.
