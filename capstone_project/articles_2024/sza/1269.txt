"The next time someone asks you "How big is #Glastonbury?", a good way to try and start explaining the magnitude of the place would be to show them this clip"
An aerial shot video has shown just how massive the Glastonbury festival actually is.
Glastonbury has returned to its annual home of Worthy Farm this week – with Dua Lipa, Coldplay, and SZA set to headline the music festival. A video captured from a hot air balloon 3000ft up in the sky has provided a bird’s eye view of just how gigantic Glastonbury is. The footage was captured at last year’s edition of the fest.
“The next time someone asks you “How big is #Glastonbury?”, a good way to try and start explaining the magnitude of the place would be to show them this clip of the Festival site captured from a hot air balloon 3000ft high in the sky,” read the caption of the video posted by Glasto Fest Feed.
The clip shows hundreds of acres of land with thousands of people crowding around different parts. You can see stages and tents as well as how neatly organised the site is.

Recently, an interactive map was created to allow users to compare Glastonbury‘s site size with anywhere in the world.
Manchester-based programmer Geoffrey Prytherch has created the tool, which allows users to enter a post code to the Glastonbury Map Overlap and see how walking across the festival site would compare to a neighbourhood walk.
The approximately 900-acre Somerset site was found to trump other festivals around the world in sheer size including Coachella (642 acres), Leeds (600 acres) and Reading (100 acres). You can test out the map here.
Prytherch, who emphasised that the map “is in no way affiliated with Glastonbury Festival” on his website, decided to build the interactive tool when an older, similar website “suddenly disappeared”, according to his blog. “I took it upon myself to reverse engineer it to keep it alive for everyone else,” he added.
Elsewhere, pictures from the above the site were shared by James Pearce, a Somerset-based paraglider, who took to the skies 1000ft above Worthy Farm over the weekend. You can view the images above.
He told BBC News: “It’s immense up there. People don’t see the scale of it – that’s why I do it.”
Elsewhere, the bar prices at Glastonbury 2024 have been shared online, with the average pint of beer or cider on site set at £6.75 with Stonewall Inn IPA topping the price range at £7 and Otter Ale coming in at the cheapest at £6.50 a pint. Cans are also set to be priced from £6.25 to £8.
This year’s edition of the festival will take place between June 26-30, with Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA due to headline the Pyramid Stage. Other confirmed acts include Shania Twain, LCD Soundsystem, Little Simz, The National, Avril Lavigne, The Last Dinner Party, Jungle, Justice, Bloc Party, Fontaines D.C., Yard Act, Arlo Parks and Gossip.
In early June, organisers revealed the full line-up, stage splits and timings for the sold-out bash – including some new names and various ‘TBA’ secret slots. The BBC has also shared its extensive coverage plans for the huge weekend of music.
As for the weather, the BBC Weather website forecast for the full five days currently shows temperatures ranging from the high-10s to the mid-20s, with sunny intervals, light winds and broadly dry conditions. Festival-goers can expect at least the first few days of their Worthy Farm visit to remain rain-free.
Meanwhile, the bookies’ odds have been published for who might be playing a secret set at Worthy Farm this year – and bets have been suspended on one huge artist already.
