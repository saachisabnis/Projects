These underthings are hardly under the radar.
Hanky Panky’s signature stretch thongs are a longtime Hollywood favorite, with fans including SZA and Jennifer Aniston.
And right now during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale the brand’s offering major markdowns on designs like the Daily Lace 3-Pack of Original Rise Thongs ($72 $48) — available in a range of colors including, black, tan, purple and lilac. 
On its website, Hanky Panky claims it sells one thong, on average, every 10 seconds across the world. (The company even trademarked its flagship fashion as “the world’s most comfortable thong.”)
Celebrities seem to agree; Aniston revealed her preference for the panties in a 2020 Interview magazine chat with Sandra Bullock, where she said she was wearing “Hanky Panky underwear if we want to get real specific.” 
While she didn’t name her exact style selection, Amazon’s discounts also include over 30% off the Signature Lace Original Rise Thong 3-Pack ($72 $50).
For those who prefer low rise, there’s also both a neutral Low Rise Thong 3-Pack ($72 $49) and a colorful option ($72 $39).
Aniston’s not the only star who’s sported Hanky Panky’s popular underpinnings over the years, as SZA, Cameron Diaz and Cher also own the brand’s styles. 
Kim Kardashian even shouted out the label in an Evening Standard interview before founding Skims, saying she “just started wearing underwear a month ago.”
Amazon reviewers are also hooked, with one shopper writing, “These are the most flattering and comfortable underwear ever!”
“Hanky Panky knows what they’re doing, and I can’t recommend them enough,” a second added, raving that “the fabric is unbeatable in comfort and incredibly flattering.”
