Even though, thanks to technology, we can hear any piece of music, or watch any concert, whenever we want, from our phones, nothing beats attending a concert.
The connection between the artist and the audience creates a unique atmosphere where fans come together to share their passion for music. The thrill of seeing a favorite performer live, hearing the music in its purest form, and feeling the energy of the crowd makes concerts exhilarating. Each show is one of a kind, filled with spontaneous moments and collective excitement, making it a memorable experience for everyone in attendance.
Over the last few months, we have seen dozens of great concerts (and a few comedy shows) announced for venues across New England.  While there were a few announcements toward the end of 2024, the announcement pace really picked up in January and February.
With numerous concerts scheduled to take place in New England this year, we aim to simplify the process of selecting the ones you'd like to attend. We have compiled a list of some of the best concerts coming to Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts in 2025.
Our list contains a mixture of rock, country, top 40, and hip-hop shows.  There are even a few comedy shows on the list.  Take a look and let us know what else deserves to be on our list.
As you can see, our list contains quite a variety of artists.  We've listed shows by Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Dua Lipa, Old Dominion, the Zac Brown Band, AC/DC, Jason Aldean, Thomas Rhett, Brooks & Dunn, Morgan Wallen, Volbeat, Post Malone, Jelly Roll,  the Lumineers, and more.
