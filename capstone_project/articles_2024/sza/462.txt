SZA is hitting the Apple Music Live stage for a special performance.
Set to debut on January 31, the SOS artist’s show was filmed at the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn, New York. SZA’s Apple Music Live set will hear her perform some of her biggest hits and fan favorites, including “Kill Bill, “Snooze,” “Seek & Destroy” and “Nobody Gets Me,” along with selections from her Ctrl debut album “Drew Barrymore,” “Broken Clocks,” “Love Galore” and More.
“SZA was one the most streamed artists of 2023 with only her second full length album, we are elated to finally bring her S.O.S Tour to Apple Music Live,” said Apple Music’s Global Head of Hip Hop and R&B Ebro Darden. “The show is, of course, incredible just like her music, her songwriting and her desire to give us, the fans, so much amazing content. Here’s to an even more successful 2024 for her. Thank You SZA!”
