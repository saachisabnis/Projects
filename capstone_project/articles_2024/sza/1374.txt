Dua Lipa dreamed of headlining Glastonbury while she was writing her first album
The 28-year-old singer will top the bill of the Worthy Farm festival this summer alongside Coldplay and SZA, 34 – and has now revealed it was on her wish list in 2017 as part of her obsession with “dream boards” and “manifestation”.
She told the ‘Dish’ podcast: “When I was writing my first album – I’m big into like dream boards and manifestation and whatever – and I had written it down that on my third record, I’d love to headline Glastonbury.”
Dua also told about how she first got told she was wanted as a Glasto headliner two years ago: “I got the call November 2022 at the end of my ‘Future Nostalgia’ tour. 
“I was like coming back from Australia and I remember checking my email and it just said, ‘Glastonbury,’ and I was like, ‘Oh, this is interesting.’ 

“I opened the email and I just go, ‘Oh my God!’

“I can’t believe what I'm reading. I just had to like refresh it a couple of times to just see that I wasn’t like tripping, and I wasn’t like jet lag delusion in the moment.

“It was just the best email of all time. I don’t think I’ve ever – I never check my email, after that? 

“Never looked at my emails ever again, because it was downhill from there. 

“It was just so surreal.”

Dua also told how she ditches alcohol while on tour to stay healthy and strong.

She said: “I guess like, once I’m in the swing of things and I have like a routine and my body is really strong and healthy – it’s just getting into stamina mode. “Then afterwards I’m fine because my body’s already at a certain kind of level. “But yeah, there’s like no drinking. Can't have hot sauce.”

‘Dish’ from Waitrose is available on all podcast providers.
