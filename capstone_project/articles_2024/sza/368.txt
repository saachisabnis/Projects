Glastonbury will return to Worthy Farm from June 26 to 30, with Dua Lipa, Coldplay, and SZA set to headline. Other confirmed acts include Shania Twain, LCD Soundsystem, Little Simz, The National, Avril Lavigne, The Last Dinner Party, Jungle, Justice, Bloc Party, Fontaines D.C., Yard Act, Arlo Parks and Gossip.
The final tickets for this year’s bash went on sale in the re-sale on April 21 and sold out in 20 minutes. The last batch was comprised of tickets that the original purchasers did not pay the balance on by the cut-off date in early April.
Competition for the tickets was fiercer than ever this year, with organiser Emily Eavis revealing that 2024 had seen the “highest percentage of ticket balances paid” since Glastonbury introduced the payment plan scheme.
Glastonbury 2024 will see the introduction of a new stage in the Shangri-La area, called Arrivals, which will be dedicated to South Asian talent. Shania Twain will take on the coveted legends slot this year, while K-pop will have its first presence at the festival with a performance from Pledis boyband SEVENTEEN on the Pyramid Stage.
NME recently compiled a list of some of the worst clashes at Glastonbury this year, including between PJ Harvey and Arlo Parks, Sleaford Mods and Orbital and IDLES  and Fontaines D.C.
The BBC Weather website forecast for the full five days currently shows temperatures in the low-to-mid-20s, with dry and sunny conditions. Festivalgoers can expect a gentle breeze or light winds over the weekend. Check out a full weather forecast here.
