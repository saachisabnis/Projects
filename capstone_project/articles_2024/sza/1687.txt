Call her Bee-yoncé, the way she can’t stay away from bouquets. From the 50,000 to 60,000 white orchids that reportedly decorated her wedding with Jay-Z to the blooming background of her second pregnancy reveal, flowers have been a consistent part of Beyoncé’s brand long before she ran for BOTUS.
No one can accuse her of keeping them to herself, though. Beyoncé has developed a reputation for sending floral arrangements to other people so frequently that stans joke the hardest worker in Hollywood is her florist. And that’s just based on the deliveries we know about (we’re sure Mama Tina, for example, has gotten flowers from her daughter many more times than we’ve seen). But don’t worry, there (probably) isn’t one overworked person pumping out an arrangement for everybody Bey appreciates. As evidenced by company logos in the cards attached to the flowers, she’s hired florists from Pennsylvania to Australia. Wherever you are, if she wants to give you your flowers, she will.
With the recent release of Cowboy Carter, we analyzed every publicly shared Bey bouquet — and we’ll keep this post updated as she inevitably continues to make more deliveries. (Since release day, she’s already found the addresses of Miley Cyrus, Mickey Guyton, K. Michelle, Tyla, Jack White, Anita Baker, and University of South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley.) Here’s a full rundown of everyone who’s gotten flowers, along with the six main reasons why. If you’re a celebrity and check one of the following areas, your chances of becoming the next recipient might be higher than you think … just not if you’re that hussy Jolene.
If it wasn’t already clear from her find-every-rare-celebrity-baby-photo era, Beyoncé takes birthdays very seriously.

➽ Tina Knowles➽ Natalia and Vanessa Bryant➽ Halle Bailey➽ Olivier Rousteing➽ Yvette Noel-Schure➽ Missy Elliott➽ Marsai Martin➽ Cardi B➽ Lizzo➽ Kim Kardashian➽ Bianca Lawson
Not only does Beyoncé celebrate when her friends get a year older, she also sends flowers to thank others who commemorate her own trips around the sun. These four all also happened to have worked with her on Black Is King.
➽ GuiltyBeatz➽ NOVA Wav (Brittany “Chi” Coney and Denisia “Blu June” Andrews)➽ Nija
Beyoncé likes to celebrate new additions to a family — not surprising for a mother of three. Maybe it’s for early networking, considering her own firstborn has grown up to be a mini manager?

➽ DJ Khaled, after the birth of his son, Asahd.➽ Katy Perry, after the birth of her daughter (who has the appropriately floral name Daisy Dove Bloom) with Orlando Bloom.➽ Keyshia Ka’oir and Gucci Mane, after welcoming their first baby together, Ice.

The saddest reason to hear from Beyoncé by far, these bouquets come after injury, illness, or death.
