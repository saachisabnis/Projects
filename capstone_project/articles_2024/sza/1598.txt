Keke Palmer brought laughter and admiration during her recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. While promoting her empowering memoir, Master of Me, Palmer shared a remarkable encounter with rap icon Nicki Minaj at the Met Gala, accompanied by a spot-on impression of the rapper.
Palmer recounted the surreal experience, revealing how Minaj interrupted a conversation with others to call her over. “She’s like, ‘Uh-uh, you, I need to talk to you, hold on,’” Palmer shared, mimicking Minaj’s signature New York-Trinidadian accent. “I’m thinking, ‘Oh no, Nicki’s about to curse me out at the Met Gala!’”
The two first connected on Instagram, where Minaj recommended famed photographer David LaChapelle for Palmer’s baby shower shoot. Despite their casual relationship, Palmer didn’t expect what came next.
Instead of a scolding, Minaj offered heartfelt advice that left Palmer deeply moved. “She said, ‘Look, I don’t read the press. I don’t know everything that’s going on. But I just want to tell you, nobody knows what it’s like when we have to turn off the lights and be with ourselves. So, you do whatever you need to do to be good with you,’” Palmer recalled in Minaj’s voice.
Stunned and grateful, Palmer responded, “YEAH! I was like, ‘Thank you for this speech! I was not expecting this.’” Fans and viewers were quick to praise Palmer’s flawless impersonation and Minaj’s genuine character. One fan wrote, “Keke kinda ate the impression of Nicki,” while another noted, “That advice was so real and pure—Nicki stays authentic on and offstage.”
Palmer also charmed Fallon with stories of her toddler son, Leo, complete with a Broadway-style theme song she wrote for him. Between raising Leo, promoting her memoir, and preparing for her comedy film with SZA, One of Them Days, Palmer continues to shine as an actress, singer, and author.
This unforgettable interaction at the Met Gala not only showcased Keke’s comedic chops but also revealed Nicki Minaj’s thoughtful and encouraging nature behind the glitz and glamour.
