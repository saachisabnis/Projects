SZA fans have a reason to be excited after the "SOS" singer confirmed the status of her upcoming project. On Saturday, November 23, the Grammy award-winning singer joined her friend Lizzo on Kai Cenat's Mafiathon 2 livestream. At one point during the 4+ hour stream, SZA decided to open up about her plans to release a "whole new project." She didn't provide a lot of details about the album at first, but she eventually caved and revealed the target release date after Cenat pressed her about it. "It'll be out before the year is over," SZA said while she sipped her wine. 
SZA has been preparing to drop not just one but two albums. During a recent interview with British Vogue, the 35-year-old singer confirmed she plans to release a deluxe version of her critically acclaimed album SOS and her next LP Lana. SZA didn't tell Kai which project she aims to drop by the end of 2024. "I think I am making music from a more beautiful place," SZA told the magazine. "From a more possible place versus a more angsty place. I’m not identifying with my brokenness. It’s not my identity. It’s shit that happened to me. Yeah, I experienced cruelty. I have to put it down at some point. Piece by piece, my music is shifting because of that, the lighter I get.”There's still no confirmed release date for the album, but it's bound to arrive soon. She just appeared twice on Kendrick Lamar's new album GNX and recently performed with Doechii during her set at Camp Flog Gnaw. With her recent appearance on Cenat's stream, it's evident she's laying the foundation before she makes more headlines in the near future. Watch the full stream below.
