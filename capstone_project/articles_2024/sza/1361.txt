Fridayy is riding high on the wave of success, and he’s not waiting for anyone else to recognize it. “Being a newly platinum artist, it’s like a trophy for me. I’m not sitting around waiting for the Grammys to give me recognition,” he says with the kind of confidence that only comes from someone who knows they’re on the right path. And who can blame him? Fridayy is making serious moves, and his latest video for “Baddest in the Room” is proof.

For this project, Fridayy went all out, embracing a “Coming to America” theme that’s both nostalgic and refreshing. The best part? LL Cool J plays his father in the video. “My manager came up with the idea for the “Coming to America” vibe, and it just worked. Remy Ma actually made the connection with LL, and it was a wrap from there,” Fridayy explains, clearly still buzzing from the experience.
When it comes to casting his videos, Fridayy keeps control. “I pick all my leading girls. And nah, I don’t get catfished—I can see through those filters,” he laughs. This isn’t just a guy who’s riding the wave of fame; Fridayy knows what he wants, and he’s got the eye to spot authenticity a mile away.
As lighthearted as Fridayy can be, the conversation takes a somber turn when he talks about the recent passing of his father. “My dad was always supportive of me, and I’m just so grateful he got to see me be successful before he passed,” he shares. It’s clear that his father’s influence runs deep, both in his music and in how Fridayy carries himself.
Despite the heavy emotional weight, Fridayy is still pushing forward. He’s currently on tour with reggae legend Buju Banton for *The Overcomer Tour*. “We’ve got two completely different styles, but it works. I get a lot of love in Jamaica,” he says. This blend of genres is yet another example of how Fridayy refuses to be boxed in.
Now signed to Def Jam, Fridayy acknowledges that recent executive changes at the label could be unsettling. “It’s scary to think how it could affect me, but right now, I’m just thankful to God I’m one of the focus artists,” he says. Even with the uncertainty, Fridayy’s optimism and faith are unwavering.
He’s also been diving deeper than ever on the writing side. Though he hasn’t named his upcoming album yet, he’s excited about the direction it’s heading. Fans should expect some of his most introspective and raw work to date.
Proudly repping his hometown, Fridayy can’t help but shout out his love for the Sixers and the best Philly cheesesteaks at Taste. But when it comes to his musical influences, he drops a bombshell that’s sure to spark debates: “Chris Brown is better than Michael Jackson,” he says. “Chris has had a longer run.”
It’s a bold statement, but then again, Fridayy isn’t one to shy away from bold moves. From his desire to collaborate with SZA to squashing recent marriage rumors, Fridayy is clearly a man with a plan—one that’s still unfolding.
With his star continuing to rise, Fridayy is taking it all in stride. He’s focused on his music, his growth, and staying true to himself. “I’m not waiting for anyone’s validation. This is my moment, and I’m making the most of it.” And with that kind of mindset, Fridayy’s future looks brighter than ever.
Whether it’s platinum plaques, big-name collaborations, or defying the odds, Fridayy is proving that he’s here to stay—and we’re all just along for the ride.
