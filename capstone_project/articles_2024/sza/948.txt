"She ain’t even let him finish, she couldn’t wait to rush outta there"
A clip of Dua Lipa reacting to a busker performing to her while at this year’s Glastonbury Festival has been going viral.
Lipa was the first artist to headline Glastonbury this year, ahead of Saturday headliner Coldplay and Sunday’s SZA, bringing out Kevin Parker as a surprise guest to sing Tame Impala’s ‘The Less I Know The Better’.
While hanging backstage in the camping grounds, the ‘New Rules’ singer was stopped by  @liamcmusic_ – a busker known for his social media videos of him playing his ukulele and performing songs to musicians.
The clip sees Lipa caught off guard as Liam approaches her, ready to play his new song.  “My name is Liam C, and I saw your Camden documentary and I thought it was amazing. Right now I am busking around Camden and I wanted to play you 30 seconds of my song and if you like it, I just want to get your reaction and that’s it,” the busker told Lipa, to which she responded with: “Sure.”

Throughout his performance, the pop singer looked visibly uncomfortable, smiling, nodding her head and looking around while holding what appeared to be a can of Diet Coke. “I love it mate, so good, so good,” she told Liam midway through his performance while walking away.
Fans have taken to X/Twitter to react to the ‘Future Nostalgia’ singer’s reaction. “I’m crying she did not give a single fuck,” wrote one user while another shared: “She ain’t even let him finish, she couldn’t wait to rush outta there.”

In a four-star review of Lipa’s Glastonbury headlining set, NME called it a “visual spectacle” that “not only becomes a glittering celebration of pop in its highest form but also serves as a reminder that even the most outlandish aspirations can become a reality”.
Elsewhere, the pop singer responded after being wrongly accused of miming during her performance at the annual Worthy Farm music bash.
Lipa became the subject of claims online that her performance on the Pyramid Stage had been “too polished to be live”. Others noted that her voice was out of sync with the image on their TV as they watched the performance live, which gave the impression she was lip-syncing – however, it was an issue that went away once technical difficulties were solved by switching to FreeView.
The pop star stayed on at Glasto after her set, and simply responded to the claims when they were put to her by a MailOnline reporter on Saturday: “I don’t mime.”
In other news, it has been rumoured that Lipa will soon unveil details of a huge show at London’s Wembley Stadium.
