In celebration of J. Cole’s newest album, Might Delete Later, Central Cee showcased a screenshot of text messages between him and Cole that led to their latest collaboration, “H.Y.B.”
The message started with Cole sending the mp3 file with a text saying, “Here go the joint, bro. If you f**k with it and get inspired to jump on it, then please feel free, could be crazy,” with a few flexing emojis. Central Cee responded, saying, “Yea, mad. Would be a pleasure, I am already inspired. Say less.”
On the photo of the screen grab, Cee mentioned, “[J. Cole,] thank you,” with the goat emoji. Shortly after, he posted a screenshot of the track, saying, “Kinda mad still.” The track was an impressive standout within the 12-track surprise LP.
While there are dope tracks on the new album, none of the records made more of a splash than his response to Kendrick Lamar’s verse on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That.” On “7 Minute Drill,” Cole rapped, “It’s a cold world, keep the heat under your seat/ I got a phone call, they say that somebody dissin’/ You want some attention, it come with extensions/ My dog like, ‘Say the word,’ he on bulls**t, he itchin’.”
“Your first s**t was classic, your last s**t was tragic/ Your second s**t put n**gas to sleep, but they gassed it/ Your third s**t was massive, and that was your prime,” he continued in the opening verse. “The rap beef ain’t realer than the s**t I seen in Cumberland/ He averagin’ one hard verse like every 30 months or somethin’.”
