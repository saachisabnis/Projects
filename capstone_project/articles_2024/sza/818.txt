It seems that Crocs can do new wrong with the onslaught of collaborations bringing the brand into new territory. To date, the brand has teamed up with the likes of Bad Bunny, Justin Bieber, SZA, Post Malone and more alongside special standouts with Balenciaga and Salehe Bembury. Well, now Crocs is upping the ante by enlisting the help of Simone Rocha for a new collaboration.
Celebrated for her subverted notion of femininity and avant-garde design elements, the Irish designer has brought new air to the world of womenswear fashion. Because of her distinct style, it makes sense that Rocha brings her flair to the ever-growing Crocs portfolio. The collaboration “explores the creative juxtaposition of femininity and utilitarianism, bringing to life new designs that combine Crocs’ practical DNA with Simone Rocha’s signature aesthetic,” said a statement from Simone Rocha’s brand.
The collaboration first made its debut during Rocha’s SS24 “The Dress Rehearsal” fashion show. Comprising the collection are the Classic Clog, the Siren and the Quicktrail. In extending the SS24’s sentiments on matrimony and ceremony, the shoes are enhanced by tiered cake-inspired embellishments made of crystal and pearls – a Simone Rocha signature. The range of shoes appear in black, cream, soft blush and light dust green colorways.
Simone Rocha’s new Crocs collaboration is set to release on April 10 in-store and online at Simone Rocha, on Crocs’ website and at Dover Street Market.
