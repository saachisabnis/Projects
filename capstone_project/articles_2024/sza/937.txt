Sexyy Red‘s performance at Rolling Loud has been met with some pushback from Hip Hop fans, and she simply doesn’t care what they have to say.
Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Friday (March 15), the rapper poked fun at herself while addressing the haters.

“Dis how it be when somebody hear you singing in da shower [laughing face emojis],” she wrote, quote-tweeting a fan who shared a clip of her performance from the venerated festival.
The video showed Red singing SZA’s section of “Rich Baby Daddy” in a notably out-of-tune voice a la Biz Markie. The fan responded, “What is this[?]” followed by a series of crying emojis.

While Sexyy Red might not have gotten much love for her singing, the “Pound Town” rapper certainly got support from her fans when she revealed that she’d like to make a special guest appearance on the hit ABC show, Abbott Elementary.
Taking to Twitter/X on Tuesday (March 12), the “Pound Town” rapper took a page out of SZA‘s manifestation book and wrote: “How I get on Abbott elementary?”

When it was announced that SZA would be appearing on Sesame Street earlier this month, the SOS singer shared a post from 2017 similar to Red’s that read: “HOW DOES ONE GET ON SESAME STREET !?”
Though it took years, it happened for SZA, so perhaps fans will soon be seeing the rapper walk through the halls of the beloved (fictional) Philadelphia elementary school.

When The Shade Room shared Sexyy Red’s post, the comments were overwhelmingly positive as fans brainstormed different roles she could play.
“Let her be somebody mama coming late to pick up her kids. Please!” one person wrote, while another said: “She can be Ava’s little sister.”

On the music side of things, Sexyy Red just teased a brand-new song — with a little help from one of Soulja Boy‘s old ones.
The St. Louis rhymer hopped on social media on March 9 to share an excerpt of a new song. But she synced up the audio to a 2008 clip of Soulja Boy and crew dancing to his unreleased song “Crank That Billie Jean,” tagging the rapper in the process.
