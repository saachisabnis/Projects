Pump the brakes – Tracy Chapman may perform live for the first time in years with Luke Combs at the Grammys on Sunday. 
Sources tell Variety that Chapman, 59, will hit the stage with country star Combs, 33, to perform “Fast Car” — her 1988 smash hit that also brought Combs success when he covered and released it last year.
The Post has contacted reps for the Recording Academy, Chapman, and Combs for comment. 
Combs’ version of “Fast Car” reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the summer, surpassing Chapman’s version, which peaked at No. 6 over three decades ago.
Chapman closed the 1989 Grammys with the song. That night, she won three awards: Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Contemporary Folk Recording.
Combs and Billy Joel, Joni Mitchell, SZA, Dua Lipa, Travis Scott, Billie Eilish, Burna Boy and Olivia Rodrigo are already confirmed to perform at Sunday’s award show.
Chapman’s last significant public performance was the night before the 2020 presidential election on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” to perform “Talkin’ ‘Bout a Revolution.”
In July, she gushed to Billboard about Combs’ cover of her classic. 
“I never expected to find myself on the country charts, but I’m honored to be there,” she wrote in a statement. 
“I’m happy for Luke and his success and grateful that new fans have found and embraced ‘Fast Car,'” she added.
Combs’ camp got Chapman’s permission to release his recording as a single and subsequently received royalties and accolades for it, including Single and Song of the Year at the 2023 CMAs. 
“I’m sorry I couldn’t join you all tonight,” Chapman said in a statement from the stage at the award show. “It’s truly an honor for my song to be newly recognized after 35 years of its debut. Thank you to the CMAs and a special thanks to Luke and all of the fans of ‘Fast Car.’”
This made Chapman the first Black songwriter to win in the category. 
The Grammys air Sunday at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
