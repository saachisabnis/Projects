Kendrick Lamar’s new album GNX not only shines a spotlight on Los Angeles’ current crop of rising rappers such as AzChike, Hitta J3 and Lefty Gunplay, but contains an overt tribute to one of the city’s most famous adopted sons, Tupac Shakur.
As an ‘80s baby who grew up in L.A. — specifically Compton — during 2Pac’s prime and even witnessed the rap legend film scenes for his original “California Love” music video with Dr. Dre at the Compton Swap Meet as a kid, his love of ‘Pac is no surprise.

But for Kendrick Lamar Duckworth, it goes deeper than that. In the early hours of September 13, 2010 — exactly 14 years after 2Pac’s death — the then-up-and-coming lyricist had an eerie dream in which Shakur came to him and delivered a message that would have a profound impact on him.
“I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on mom’s couch. I’m 26 now — it wasn’t that long ago,” he recalled in a 2013 interview with GQ. “I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of ‘Pac talking to me.

“Weirdest shit ever. I’m not huge on superstition and all that shit. That’s what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, ‘Don’t let the music die.’ Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like, he’s right there. Just a silhouette.”
Explaining how the spiritual encounter influenced his approach to music, he added: “It wasn’t just about money, hos, clothes, drinking. I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there’s people out there that can’t really connect to that lifestyle. They’re in the struggle.”
Kendrick noted in a separate interview with Home Grown Radio that just a day before the “scary” vision, his mother pointed out to him that his and ‘Pac’s birthdays are just one day apart. “I never knew that shit,” he said. “That was some wild shit.”
2Pac’s words appear to have influenced Kendrick Lamar ever since. His 2015 opus To Pimp a Butterfly famously unfurled into a poem addressed to the All Eyez On Me MC, culminating in a staged conversation between the two in which K.Dot picks the brain of his Hip Hop hero.
The album was even originally called Tu Pimp a Caterpillar, which shortens to TuPAC, before Kendrick ultimately settled on its final title to “show the brightness of life,” he told MTV.

Of course, Kendrick has also explored similar themes as 2Pac throughout his catalog, from empathetic depictions of troubled women (“Keisha’s Song,” “Brenda’s Got a Baby”) to uplifting anthems of self-love (“i,” “Keep Ya Head Up”) and their relationships with their mothers (“Mother I Sober,” “Dear Mama,” which Kendrick has cited as one of his biggest inspirations).
Kendrick has even assumed the role of protector of 2Pac’s legacy in his ongoing beef with Drake, chastising the Canadian for purchasing ‘Pac’s iconic crown ring for $1 million at auction. “Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I’m ready to double the wage / I’d rather do that than let a Canadian n-gga make ‘Pac turn in his grave,” he rapped on “Euphoria,” tweaking the lyrics at his Pop Out show to: “Give me 2Pac ring back and I might give you a little respect.”

Which brings us to GNX. An early standout from the surprise album, “Reincarnated” finds Kendrick channeling his Gemini twin‘s spirit, cadence and penchant for internal rhymes over a prominent sample of “Made N-ggaz,” a 2Pac deep cut from the Death Row Records soundtrack to the 1997 film Gang Related which ‘Pac starred in opposite Jim Belushi.
The track opens with Kendrick revealing that last year he tried past life regression, a form of hypnotherapy that aims to help people access memories of past lives, and the experience “fucked [him] up.” All signs point to Kendrick delving deeper into his kindred connection with 2Pac. Instead, he raps about previously being a gifted blues guitarist from the 1940s (seemingly John Lee Hooker) and a female Chitlin’ Circuit singer who achieved fame and fortune but succumbed to substance abuse (most likely Dinah Washington).
After stepping back into his current physical form, Kendrick enacts a conversation with God that feels very 2Pac-esque — a man of faith with a good heart and grand ambitions but also flaws and contradictions, wrestling with an internal struggle of “trying to push peace in L.A.” yet wanting to see his enemies burn. Even without being explicitly mentioned, 2Pac looms large over the sonic seance.
“Reincarnated” is also a subtle flex of the cultural cachet that Kendrick possesses over Drake. Early on in their feud, the 6 God controversially used AI to recreate 2Pac’s vocals — as well as those of another of Kendrick’s idols, Snoop Dogg — on his diss song “Taylor Made Freestyle.” The track angered the estate of 2Pac, who threatened Drake with legal action and ordered him to take it down (which he complied with soon after).
Kendrick, meanwhile, who was referred to as “a good friend to the estate who has given nothing but respect to Tupac and his legacy” by lawyers for the late rapper, evidently had his sample clearance request for “Made N-ggaz” granted. This further illustrates a point Kendrick has made throughout the beef: I’m of the culture; you colonize the culture.

2Pac’s influence on GNX is further felt on the album’s closing song “Gloria.” On first listen, the tender track sounds like an ode to Kendrick’s longtime partner Whitney Alford, who was callously dragged into his feud with Drake. But in a twist reminiscent of Common‘s “I Used to Love H.E.R.,” the “bitch” with whom he shares a loving but “complicated” bond turns out to be his pen. (It’s been speculated that “Gloria” is named after the line of luxury Laban pens.)
On his final and ferocious album The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, ‘Pac deploys this exact same technique, crafting a metaphorical love song dedicated to his gun. “Me and My Girlfriend” (which was, of course, inspired by Nas‘ “I Gave You Power” and later reworked by JAY-Z and Beyoncé on “’03 Bonnie & Clyde”) features venomous dialog from Virginya Slim who personifies his trusty tool, a move mirrored by SZA who barks on “Gloria” (as Kendrick’s pen): “I gave you life! I breathe the muthafuckin’ charisma in this bitch! I bring the blessings! I gave you power!”

More than a decade into his decorated career, and almost 15 years after that profound vision, it’s clear that 2Pac remains a guiding light for Kendrick Lamar. His current M.O. may be watching the party die, but when it comes to the powerful and prescient music of Tupac Shakur, he remains intent on keeping it alive.
“This shit is real for me,” Kendrick said in his aforementioned interview with Home Grown Media. “I’m not only doing it for myself anymore; I’m doing it for people around me, my city, of course, and for a bigger power — and that’s to continue the message that [2Pac] tried to carry on.”
