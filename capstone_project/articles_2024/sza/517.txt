Ellie Goulding displayed her toned abs in a sequin co-ord as she arrived at RAYE's BRIT Awards afterparty at Decimo at The Standard in London on Saturday night. 
The singer, 37, looked incredible as she changed into the black dazzling bandeaux crop top and matching maxi skirt.
She added inches to her frame in a pair of towering heels and accessorised with a pair of silver drop earrings.
Ellie, who was styled by Kyle De’Volle, draped a black satin wrap off her shoulders and completed her evening look with a long pair of coordinated gloves.
Leaving her long blonde tresses loose, Ellie donned a glamorous palette of makeup including a bold blue eye shadow.

Ahead of the afterparty, Ellie was spotted departing the O2 Arena crouching backwards in her car. 
She seemed in high spirits as she climbed into the vehicle wearing her rose gold wrap Alberta Ferretti dress.
Earlier in the night she commanded attention on the star-studded red carpet in the glamorous number as she went braless. 
The Love Me Like You Do singer - who recently confirmed her new relationship with surf instructor Armando Perez - exuded glamour as her elegant garment featured a one-shoulder high cowl neck and a meter-long train.
Her dress showcased her toned figure as a side panel flashed her washboard abs and belly button.

She added inches to her statuesque figure as she paired her chic look with a pair of towering Jimmy Choo 'Max Bing' silver platforms, priced at £954.
To accessorise, the singing sensation went full out as she donned a bejewelled armband and a pair of diamond sun dangly earrings.
During the evening Ellie took to the stage with Calvin Harris and ITV viewers branded her performance 'amazing' and the 'highlight' of the entire evening.
She announced last week her four-year marriage to Caspar Jopling, 31, had ended after she was pictured cosying up to hunky surf instructor Arrmando Perez.
But music was solely the focus for Ellie this weekend as she stormed the stage with her and Calvin Harris' hit Miracle.
The songstress stunned in a white ruffled bodysuit and thigh-high boots which showed off her gym-honed physique.
Racing to X, formerly Twitter, fans gushed over the set branding it 'amazing' 'perfect' and 'iconic'.
One said: 'Ellie Goulding's perfomance has been the highlight of the night. It was fabulous'.
While a second wrote: 'Incredible song / perfomance from Calvin Harris & Ellie Goulding'.

Raye broke records at Saturday night's BRIT Awards, winning six gongs during a star-studded ceremony at London's O2 arena.
The singer/songwriter, 26, scooped the first gong presented on the night, Song of the Year for her hit Escapism ft 070 Shake, shortly before also taking home the R&B Act gong and Best New Artist.
She was in floods of tears as she later accepted Album Of The Year, Artist Of The Year and Songwriter of the Year, bringing her beloved grandmother on stage at one point.
The star now holds the record for the most BRITs won at a single ceremony, a record which previously stood at four, jointly held by Blur (1995), Adele (2016) and Harry Styles (2023). 
Raye had been nominated eight times – the most ever for a single artist in a year – including two nods for song of the year, for Escapism, which won the title, and Prada. 
As well as Raye’s huge successes, Dua Lipa won best pop act while Kylie Minogue – who had a massive comeback hit last year with Padam Padam – picked up the global icon award. The night was dominated by female winners, who won gongs in all but four categories.
