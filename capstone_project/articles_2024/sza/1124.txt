SZA admitted getting a Brazilian butt lift was not all that it was cracked up to be.
“I’m so mad I did that s–t,” the “Snooze” singer said in British Vogue’s December issue published Thursday.
The 35-year-old decided to get the procedure done after not seeing results from hitting the gym in early 2022.
“I gained all this weight from being immobile while recovering and trying to preserve the fat. It was just so stupid,” she said. “But who gives a f–k? You got a BBL, you realize you didn’t need the s–t.”
She said that the procedure just “wasn’t super necessary” because there was other areas she needed to work on that were more important.
“I need to get my f–king mental health together,” she told the mag, adding, “Not to say you can’t do those things simultaneously, just, for me, I realize wherever you go, there you’ll be.”
Despite expressing regret on her decision to alter her body with plastic surgery, SZA did express her adoration for her physique.
“But I love my butt. Don’t get me wrong. My booty look nice,” she shared. “And I’m grateful that it looks pretty much… I don’t know, sometimes natural, but I don’t even care.”
“It’s something that I wanted. I’m enjoying it. I love shaking it.”
The Grammy winner also revealed that hasn’t ruled out future cosmetic procedures.
“It doesn’t matter. I’ll do a whole bunch more shit just like it if I want to before I’m f–king dead because this body is temporary,” SZA said.
The musician previously sang about getting her “body done” in her 2022 song “SOS,” which was featured on SZA’s album of the same name.
“So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it’s not,” she sings on the track.
This isn’t the first time that SZA has addressed her BBL, as she previously spoke about it during a May 2023 interview with Elle.
“I treat my butt like a purse,” she told the magazine.
“It’s just there to enhance whatever else. And that’s why I paid for it, because it works all by itself.”
