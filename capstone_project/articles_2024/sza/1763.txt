SZA, the multi-talented singer-songwriter, recently shared a memorable encounter with comedian Katt Williams while filming her first movie. In a candid conversation with rapper Kendrick Lamar for Harper’s Bazaar, SZA recalled how Williams jokingly told her she was “mentally ill,” but meant it as a compliment.
“We shot a movie last night. I’ve never shot a movie before, so I was freaking out,” she explained. The New Jersey-born artist, known for hits like “20 Somethings” and “Good Days,” admitted that being on set for the first time was intimidating. “It’s a lot of being scared to be myself,” she added.
SZA then delved into her unexpected interaction with Williams, revealing how the comedian’s unique humor helped ease her nerves. “I met Katt Williams [on set]. He told me I was mentally ill, like, as a compliment,” SZA shared. She recalled the moment in more detail, adding, “He was like, ‘Sa, I believe you might have some mental—’ And I was like, ‘Illness?’ And he was like, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Oh, welcome.’”
While some might have found the comment offensive, SZA laughed it off and seemed to understand the intent behind Williams’ words. His playful remark, though unusual, helped lighten the mood during what was an overwhelming experience for her.
SZA is stepping into new territory with her acting debut, joining an impressive cast that includes Lil Rel Howery, Janelle James, and Maude Apatow. Directed by Lawrence Lamont, the upcoming R-rated comedy is expected to release on January 24, 2025, with Issa Rae’s production company, Hoorae, behind the film.
Reflecting on the experience, SZA expressed her anxiety about the project. “I’m either gonna pretend it never happened or not show up to the premiere,” she joked. But with support from co-stars like Williams, her venture into acting is shaping up to be a memorable journey.
The film’s title is still under wraps, but with a star-studded cast and SZA’s versatility, fans are eager to see her on the big screen.
