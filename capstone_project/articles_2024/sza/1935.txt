Really Miley’s win was a shock for anybody? Personally I had it very clear after she overperformed with nominations. I was surprised she lost SOTY lol 
Many people were saying she would go 0/6 until Grammy’s night.
There’s already 31 songs on that fucking thing. It’s already bloated. There’s only so much people can take hearing the same recycled piano balllads about Matty Healy, Travis Kelce, Joe Alwyn, Kanye West & Kim Kardashian over and over.
i know but it’s a live performance of the entire album, this time there’s and audience! An intimate concert! This is amazing!!! 😱 she’s coming to win two in a row! 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

Yeah, they also were saying she would’ve underperform with nominations. Some people were predicting a total snub. But since the nominations proved they were wrong, not predicting her was just a hope-prediction of Flowers’ haters.
In context of what some users talked before, here are Country/Americana albums in AOTY and their performance this century 
2023 – In These Silent Days (LOST)
2019 – Golden Hour (WON)
2019 – By the Way, I Forgive You (LOST)
2017 – A Sailor’s Guide to Earth (LOST)
2016 – Traveller (LOST)
2014 – Red (LOST)
2013 – Babel (WON)
2011 – Need You Now (LOST)
2010 – Fearless (WON)
2009 – Raising Sand (WON)
2008 – These Days (LOST)
2007 – Taking The Long Way (WON)
2003 – Home (LOST)
2002 – O Brother, Where Art Thou? (WON)
2002 – Love And Theft (LOST)
Percentage of winning: 38%
Get real!  For the billionth time, Beyoncé will NOT win Album of the Year.  Pure delusion.  We go through this every time the bitch is in contention.  Voters prefer white people over her.  No fucking way Billie Eilish loses.

I was shouted down by Gucci for saying Miley would win. 
I was also shouted down by Gucci for saying Harry Styles & Lizzo would win.
For your 2026 Grammy consideration

Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”
More than Gucci’s continued claims about them preferring white people over her. She typically has a raw deal for different reasons.
In this case, CC came and went. It had hype due to the Superbowl stunt but the album is not great which is why it hasn’t lasted as long as her other works. Texas hold em is a sure nom but just like other material it’s contrived in nature to the point where it works from an entertainment standpoint but also takes away from the artistic standpoint (which has been an issue for her time and time again).
The one point I agree with is no major R&B/Hip hop artist being a threat (i.e. Kendrick or SZA) to take away votes helps her. A bunch of pop artists likely will take away from both Billie and Bey but moresoe Billie.
Billie can make up the difference with the alternative votes. I don’t know why people genuinely think a bunch of country and Americana voters will vote for Beyonce over Billie as her ‘country’ album doesn’t seem like her new direction moresoe taking advantage of the success of country popularity of the past years. Similary with Post Malone’s album…he’s not seen as a country artist he’s seen as someone dipping into country when it is popular. that feels gimmicky and takes away from the authenticity of the artistry which has been Beyonce’s problem often in the AOTY category.
Hopefully she campaigns but other than a sympathy Jay z called us out win she lacks the pathway to actually win. Maybe if this was pushed like Lemonade she’d have a stronger shot.
 I was shouted down by Gucci for saying Miley would win. I was also shouted down by Gucci for saying Harry Styles & Lizzo would win. 
Gucci was also wrong about Taylor.
I think the only time they are right when they discuss Beyonce but Miley was going to win ROTY. It checked all boxes. I’m still shocked how many people thought she would get snubbed when she made an instant classic and lived out the narrative of from Hannah Montana to wild child to experimental to making a great (safe) record for all generations. Of course, that would be rewarded.
Interested to see a lot of people having Chappell still winning BNA despite SNS’s big success, I thought more people would switch over.
the album is not great
According to who? Definitely not reviewers 
Honey, I also am NOT sold on “Die With a Smile” winning Record of the Year and Song of the Year.  It is “Shallow” 2.0.  Everyone and their mama thought “Shallow” was winning all of its nominations.  Just because these songs check all the boxes, means nothing.
Die With a Smile first weeks are definitely bigger than Shallow’s. That song debuted at #28 in Billboard and didn’t become huge till the movie premiere. Die With A Smile debuted at #3 and it’s doing 11M streams on its third week. 
Honey, Cowboy Crap is NOT a good album.  It is rather obvious Beyoncé was jumping on the Country bandwagon.  That albums reeks of pure desperation.  Also, it does NOT matter if Beyoncé campaigns.  Voters know she is NOT a real artist.  Best believe voters know about her songwriting scandals.  Homegirl shot herself in the foot claiming she writes all of her own songs.
‘HIT ME HARD AND SOFT’ by Billie Eilish has reached 3 BILLION streams on Spotify.
It’s her 4th project to achieve this. pic.twitter.com/JYm1xrjE0y

That’s very good, but a duet with Bruno Mars was always going to debut better than one with Bradley Cooper
