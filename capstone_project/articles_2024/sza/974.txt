West Coast hip-hop polymath ScHoolboy Q is celebrating one decade of his major label debut with a limited-edition vinyl release of Oxymoron (10th Anniversary Edition).
The record, which features fan-favorite tracks such as “Pusha Man” and “Californication,” featuring A$AP Rocky, will be released on June 14 via Interscope Records. Notably, it will then arrive in clear and silver versions at Target retail stores across the country on July 26.
The renowned project first met the world on February 25, 2014, when it claimed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart and later earned platinum certification. Among the top tracks, “Collared Greens,” featuring Kendrick Lamar, went four times platinum; “Man of the Year” went three times platinum; “Studio,” featuring BJ The Chicago Kid, went three times platinum; and “What They Want,” featuring 2 Chainz, earned gold certification. In 2014, Oxymoron earned a Grammy nomination for “Best Rap Album.”
