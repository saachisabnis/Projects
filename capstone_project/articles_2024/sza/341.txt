Chris Brown was quick with a rebuttal this week after a fan called him out for having multiple children with different mothers.
The fan’s comment was written under a carousel post Breezy shared to Instagram on Tuesday (January 9), which featured pictures of his youngest daughter Lovely‘s second birthday party.

Both of the singer’s other two children and their respective mothers were also in attendance – which prompted a fan to share her dating preferences while shaming Chris’ lifestyle in the process.
“Beautiful,” the woman wrote with hearts, “but I don’t want a man with multiple baby mammas.” And CB hilariously responded: “Who said I was hiring ma’am? You say that like you had a chance [laughing emojis].”
You can view the original post below:
Chris Brown shares two-year-old Lovely with Diamond Brown [the pair aren’t married, they just happen to have the same last name], as well as four-year-old Aeko Catori with ex Ammika Harris and nine-year-old Royalty with Nia Guzman.
On the music side of things, the “Sensational” singer scored yet another Top 10 debut on the Billboard 200 in November. It was a bittersweet moment for the R&B star, however, as it also marked a new commercial low.

11:11 debuted at No. 9 on the chart in November after earning just over 45,000 equivalent album units, according to Luminate.
It marks the singer’s 12th Top 10 solo effort on the chart, a streak that stretches back to his self-titled debut album in 2005.
On the flip side, 11:11 also represents the lowest initial sales week of Brown’s career. For comparison, his previous low was 68,000, which his Heartbreak on a Full Moon LP achieved back in 2017.
