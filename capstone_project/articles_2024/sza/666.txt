The Disconnect hit maker is nominated for the third consecutive year for Dance Act, which she won in 2022 and 2023.
The drum and bass duo are shortlisted for Group of the Year for the second time, having first been nominated in this category in 2012.
They join the already-announced Dua Lipa, Kylie Minogue and RAYE for what is the UK's biggest night in music.

Meanwhile, hosts Yinka Bokinni and Jack Saunders have also been confirmed to present The BRITs' Red Carpet from 7.30pm on ITV2 and The BRITs' Aftershow.
Becky is no stranger to the bash, having previously performed at The BRITs in 2023 alongside David Guetta.
She said: 'I can't wait to perform again on the BRITs and it's been difficult trying to top flying from the ceiling of the O2 last year, but I'm excited about what we have planned for this year's performance.
'I've been a fan of Chase and Status my whole life, so to have them on stage performing with me is going to be really special. It's a real celebration of drum and bass - my favourite genre of music!'
Chase and Status said: 'For us as producers and artists, being nominated for a BRIT is a special thing.
'It is a representation of where British music is at, at the highest level, so to be in that category is an honour. Also, performing with Becky, a fellow BRIT nominee, is pretty special too.'
The latest addition to the lineup follows Nigerian Afrowave superstar Rema and Jungle being confirmed to take to the stage.
Nominations were announced last month, and nominees include Arlo Parks, Blur, Calvin Harris, Central Cee, Dave, Dua Lipa, Fred again.., Jessie Ware, J Hus, Little Simz, Olivia Dean, Mahalia, PinkPantheress, Miley Cyrus, Olivia Rodrigo, RAYE, The Rolling Stones, SZA, Taylor Swift, and Young Fathers.

Yinka and Jack will front the new live switchover show, The BRITs' Aftershow, which is a brand new live switchover show for ITVX premiering immediately after the main show on ITV1 - a first for ITVX.
The show will bring backstage and unseen exclusives from the awards show, behind-the-scenes action from and around the awards, and exclusive interviews with artists and award winners.
Speaking about the opportunity, Yinka said: 'Hosting the nominations show, Bring on the BRITs, earlier this year was so amazing. It's an honour to be back so soon and host the Red Carpet show for ITV2. A dream! 
'Super excited to do this alongside my mate Jack Saunders too. I honestly can't wait to catch up with the nominees and to be part of such an iconic evening celebrating the world's biggest talent. Here we go…!'
Jack added: 'Being a presenter for The BRIT Awards on the night has been a lifelong dream of mine. I can't wait to rock the red carpet with Yinka and bring a bit of fun and chaos to the night.'
