(*shakes fist at rain*)
While fun levels were high, the Big Gig was not quite as big of a gig these past three weekends – at least certainly compared to last year, according to Summerfest, which revealed the attendance numbers for 2024's edition of the lakefront music festival. 

The Big Gig announced today that 555,925 people attended the three-weekend festival this year – a larger total than 2021 (409,386) and 2022 (445,611), but notably behind last year's turnout (624,407) as far as post-COVID Summerfest numbers go. (Pre-pandemic, Summerfest drew numbers in the 700,000s, but those years also hosted two more additional days across its 11-day format.)

In the announcement, Summerfest notes weather – such as on day three, when storms and tornado watchs threatened to cancel the likes of SZA and Goo Goo Dolls – as the culprit for the drop in numbers, arguing this year's festival endured the most rain it's seen since 2000's edition. 

“Summerfest once again hosted one of the most unique music festival lineups available anywhere," said Sarah Pancheri, President and CEO of Milwaukee World Festival, Inc., in the announcement. "While the frequency of the rain was a challenge, our team appreciates the support of our sponsors, artists, vendors and fans as we absolutely found the Summerfest spirit throughout the run in 2024."







The attendance doesn't tell the entire story of a Summerfest, though. Because while the numbers may have taken a dip this summer, the entertainment and enjoyment factor still felt high down on the lakefront these past three weeks – between all the tasty new foods (fried bologna sandwich, for the win) and of course the new musical memories made on Summerfest's stages. And this year's festival certainly set a record for the most Kardashians in attendance, which has to count for something!

As for looking ahead to 2025's hopefully less soggy Summerfest, unlike last year, the Big Gig did not simultaneously announce its dates for next year's edition – so have fun debating and speculating on whether or not that means they're thinking about ditching the three-weekend format! And stay tuned to OnMilwaukee when those new dates and updates are announced.

As much as it is a gigantic cliché to say that one has always had a passion for film, Matt Mueller has always had a passion for film. Whether it was bringing in the latest movie reviews for his first grade show-and-tell or writing film reviews for the St. Norbert College Times as a high school student, Matt is way too obsessed with movies for his own good.
When he's not writing about the latest blockbuster or talking much too glowingly about "Piranha 3D," Matt can probably be found watching literally any sport (minus cricket) or working at - get this - a local movie theater. Or watching a movie. Yeah, he's probably watching a movie.
