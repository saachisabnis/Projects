To accessorise, she wore a shiny black clutch, an embellished choker and a pair of sparkly long earrings which hovered over her shoulders.
Mutya put on a very busty display as she opted for a daring black garment, which featured large gold paperclip details that cinched in her hour-glass waist.
She showcased her ample cleavage and stunning chest tattoos in a daring low-cut dress which featured a perilously high thigh-split.
Adding inches to her jaw-dropping figure with a pair of towering platform heels.
