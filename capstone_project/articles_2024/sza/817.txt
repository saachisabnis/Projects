WEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA – OCTOBER 12: Hip-hop artist Young Thug attends a release party for his new album “PUNK” at Delilah on October 12, 2021 in West Hollywood, California. 
Young Thug is clearing up who the woman in his life is after a video of his jail cell being checked by guards went viral. In the video, a guard is checking Thugger's belongings assumingly so for any contraband. As the guard flips through the rapper's books, newspapers, and mattress, photos on the wall show photos of R&B singer Mariah the Scientist, whom he is currently dating. However, fans took a closer look to see that the rapper's Jerrika Karlae was also featured in his jail cell.
Young Thug broke his silence on the matter with a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a post of Mariah the Scientist writing, "All I want. All I see."
Fans noticed that he has also used that caption for his ex and screenshotted the post as a reply.
Last week, Young Thug and Mariah the Scientist were trending after their video call was leaked. The video showed Thug and the R&B singer talking about their Christmas and how much they miss one another.
"What’s up, baby. Merry Christmas," Mariah says before blowing a kiss to the rapper. "I love you. I miss you and I love you. Thanks for my gifts."
Thug says that he loves and misses her too and then asks: "Them chains heavy?"
Mariah responds: "They’re heavier than the bracelets for sure. I miss you."
Thug says, "I thought the Cubans were bigger too. They 14 I think."
"I like it a lot, I’m very appreciative. Thanks babe," Mariah responds. "I miss you. I wish that you could be at home with me. You could put it on me. I miss you."
Drake even commented on the video circulating, saying that it was an invasion of privacy.
"This gotta be some form of jail misconduct," he wrote in a comment on DJ Akademiks' Instagram post of the leak phone call. "You gonna drag this talented man then not be able to control your employees using his personal business for their own gain?"
"Somebody benefitted from this video even existing and that’s shameful whole case is a wash just 3 the guy and let him come home and continue bringing light to Atlanta."
Drake then took a screenshot of his comments and posted it to his own Instagram Story adding, "S--- is disgraceful… is this a criminal case or Atlanta social media promo Ural Glanville?"
It's hard to believe that these albums will be celebrating their fifth anniversary. Many projects on this list cemented artists' placement in hip-hop while others had an unfortunate downfall in the coming years.
Megan Thee Stallion is one of the artists on this list who has continued flourishing. That year, Megan Thee Stallion released her first commercial mixtape, Fever. However, she was already heating up on the internet with the release of her two prior mixtapes and her viral freestyles (if you know, you know).
"Big Ole Freak," which was released a year prior to Fever, was the rapper's breakout hit and her first certified platinum record.
Since then, Megan has been keeping busy in the studio and has released two full-length projects. Her debut album, Good News, arrived in 2020 with hits such as "Body," "Girls in the Hood," and "Savage Remix" featuring Beyoncé. The track was nominated for "Record of the Year," and it took home the Grammy for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. Megan also snagged Best New Artist that year.
"Writing this album, I treated it more like writing in my diary than actually trying to put together a song," the rapper said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. "I just want to talk about how I really feel and get personal with my hotties."
In 2023, Megan released "Cobra," where she addressed the loss of her parents, the 2020 shooting incident by Tory Lanez, and her ex-boyfriend Pardison Fontaine's alleged cheating. She also was featured on Cardi B's "Bongos," and did a collab with Renée Rapp titled "Not My Fault" for the Mean Girls soundtrack.
As for 2024, she said that a new project is on the way which will be funded by herself since leaving her label.
"This part of my album is very much so funded by Megan Thee Stallion because we’re trying to get off… Y’all know what’s the tea. But I have no label right now," she explained on Instagram Live. "We’re doing everything funded straight out of Megan Thee Stallion’s pockets. So, the budget is coming from me. Motherf—ing Hot Girl Productions! The next s— y’all about to see is all straight from Megan Thee Stallion’s brain and Megan Thee Stallion’s wallet. We are in my pockets, hotties, so let’s do our big one."
"It’s really just me this go around until we sign to a new label. But I don’t want to sign to a new label right now because I just want to do it myself," she shared.
Take a look at these projects from 2019 that were so good that we still listen to them today:
The rap album of 2019 needs no introduction but here it goes. Tyler, The Creator, produced the entirety of <em>Igor</em> solely by himself, proving him to be a strong producer as well as vocal talent. It also had a string of guest appearances from artists such as Kanye West, Solange, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti and Jerrod Carmichael. The 12 track album produced popular songs such as the lead single "Earfquake," "Gone, Gone/Thank You," ""I Think," and "New Magic Wand." The project brought a couple of first for Tyler such as his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and his first Grammy win for Best Rap Album in 2020.
DaBaby had a phenomenal 2019 with the release of two projects: <em>Baby On Baby</em> and then <em>Kirk</em>. <em>Baby On Baby</em> was the rapper's debut album which he had assistance from Rich Homie Quan, Offset, Rich the Kid and Stunna 4 Vegas as guest features. The album debuted at No. 25 on the Billboard 200 and then crept to No. 7 on the chart. "Suge," "Goin Baby," and "Baby Sitter," were popular songs on the 13-track album. The lead single "Suge" was nominated for two Grammys: Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. <em>Baby On Baby</em> was released in March and six months later he followed up with his second studio album <em>Kirk.</em>
Young Thug's debut album title is so fitting to his demeanor because it is just <em>So Much Fun.</em> The YSL collective boss' first official project has help from Future, J. Cole, Gunna, Lil Baby, Lil Uzi Vert, 21 Savage, Travis Scott, Quavo, Machine Gun Kelly, NAV, Lil Duke, and the late Juice Wrld and Lil Keed. The album had popular songs such as "The London" with J. Cole and "Hot" with Gunna. <em>So Much Fun</em> debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
While Megan Thee Stallion had been getting some buzz for some time, releasing two prior mixtapes, she released her debut commercial mixtape under 300 Entertainment and 1501 Certified in 2019. <em>Fever</em> continued her success as she was ushered more into mainstream hip-hop with songs such as "Shake That," "Cash S---" and "Simon Says." She later followed <em>Fever</em> with her EP <em>Suga</em> and her debut album <em>Good News</em> in 2020. <em>Fever</em> debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200.
Winning a championship is just what it feels like while listening to Meek Mill's fourth studio album. The Philadelphia rapper's 2019 offering <em>Championships</em> had guest appearances from Jay-Z, Cardi B, Drake, Ella Mai, Rick Ross, Future, Young Thug, PNB Rock, 21 Savage, Jeremih, and more. Songs such as "24/7," featuring Ella Mai, "Going Bad," featuring Drake, and "Dangerous," featuring Jeremih and the late PNB Rock were staple songs on the project. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammys.
It's hard to believe it's been five years since we got a solo album from 21 Savage. At least we have <em> I AM &gt; I WAS</em> to hold us over. <em> I AM &gt; I WAS</em> is the second studio album from 21 with features from J. Cole, Offset, The City Girls, and more. The song that is one of 21's to date is "A Lot" featuring J. Cole which won both artists their first Grammy for Best Rap Song. The LP debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and was nominated Best Rap Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards.
Kanye West decided to delve into gospel music for ninth studio album. <em>Jesus Is King</em> had guest appearances from Ty Dolla $ign, Ant Clemons, Clipse, Fred Hammond, Kenny G and the Sunday Service Choir. <em>Jesus Is King</em> had two singles: "Follow God," and "Closed On Sundays." On release day it also was accompanied by a concert film of the same name. The album won Best Contemporary Christian Music Album at the 2021 Grammys. It also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 making Ye's ninth consecutive No. 1 on the chart.
<em>Hollywood Is Bleeding</em> is Post Malone's third studio album. The New York native had features from SZA, Future, DaBaby, Travis Scott, Swae Lee, and more. The album included his No. 1 hit with Swae Lee from the <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> soundtrack. The record was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year at the 2019 Grammys. <em>Hollywood Is Bleeding</em> also produced songs such as "Wow," "Circles," and "Goodbyes" featuring Young Thug. It also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
<em>Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial</em> was Roddy Ricch's introduction to mainstream hip-hop and in 2019 you couldn't go anywhere without hearing the project. It's no surprise that all four singles on the album are at least certified platinum which are "Big Stepper", "High Fashion", featuring Mustard, "Start wit Me" featuring Gunna, and "Tip Toe" featuring A Boogie wit da Hoodie. The album also has features from Lil Durk, Meek Mill and Ty Dolla $ign. <em>Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial</em> landed the Compton, CA native scored two Grammys in 2021 including  Best Rap Song and Best Melodic Rap Performance for "The Box." He was also nominated that year for his feature on DaBaby's "Rockstar" which earned three nominations for Best Rap Song, Best Melodic Rap Performance, and Record of the Year coming out with total of five nominations that night for Roddy. <em>Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial</em> also debuted at No. 1 where it stayed atop the chart for four weeks.
