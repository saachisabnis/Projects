Isaiah Rashad is starting to celebrate Cilvia Demo‘s 10th anniversary a few days early. Ahead of the album’s tenth anniversary on January 28, Rashad has joined forces with Spotify to offer up a special edition of his acclaimed debut album.
Rashad performed solo (though he did bring SiR along), posted up in the intimate, homely Spotify Studio to deliver live performances of four of the album’s signature tracks: “Menthol,” “Rip Kevin Miller,” “Shot You Down” and, of course, “Heavenly Father.”
“Shot You Down” is cut short, however, not clocking in at its studio length of over seven minutes. Rashad also performed one of Civlia Demo‘s two SZA features, “Ronnie Drake,” though the song didn’t make it onto the anniversary EP.

“Isaiah Rashad came to Spotify Studios, Los Angeles for a special performance to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his debut EP, Cilvia Demo,” the video opens.
Throughout the performance, he shares more about the making of the timeless album, opening up about his time spent working with SZA. ”SZA gives me a lot of respect in the studio that I really didn’t expect to have,” he explains. “She really boosted my head … I probably wouldn’t be doing some of the sh*t I do at the studio.”
Rashad marks the first artist to kick off Spotify’s new video series, TEN, which will continue to celebrate the 10th anniversary of iconic albums.
