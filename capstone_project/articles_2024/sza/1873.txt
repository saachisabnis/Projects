London Fashion Week began last Friday (February 16) and presented some of the most daring‚Äîsome may say bizarre‚Äîlooks to the fashion community. This marks the 40th anniversary of the event, which takes place twice a year in the English capital and is described as ‚Äúa showcase of creativity, innovation, and talent.‚Äù
LFW February 2024 included 107 brands that showcased their designs on 43 different catwalks. However, many social media users chose to focus on one designer in particular: Greek creator Dimitra Petsa.
Established in London in 2019, her womenswear label Di Petsa has sparked conversation online over her rather peculiar designs.

Stars like Anya Taylor Joy,SZA, and Zendaya have previously donned her bold designs before. Still, it was Di Petsa‚Äôs runway looks showcased at the BFC NEWGEN Show Space that caught everyone‚Äôs attention.
One of her wonderful yet weird ensembles was a sheer cream dress with a torso cut-out to reveal a model‚Äôs impregnated womb.
The model strutted down the catwalk wearing an intricate diamond-encrusted headpiece that slightly covered her eyes and nose.

Di Petsa‚Äôs characteristic ‚Äúwet look‚Äù was achieved thanks to the dress‚Äô shirred texture.
According to the brand‚Äôs description on the LFW website, Di Petsa honors ‚Äúthe female subject in space, the intimate space, the personal space, the social space, the public space. Our bodily fluids, water filtered through our bodies, bodily water. Holy water, Sea water.‚Äù

The brand‚Äôs description further states: ‚ÄúIf you cry in public you must hide it If you sweat in public you must hide it If you breastfeed in public you must hide it. We are analyzing this censorship, in regards to social behavior and proposing that the way we perceive our bodily waters has an immediate connection to how we misuse and relate to the oceans.‚Äù
Another of their talked-about runway moments included an interpretative performance between two models.
The pair, who took to the runway at the same time, wore sheer skin-toned mesh dresses. At one point, one of the models got on her knees and positioned herself inside the other woman‚Äôs elastic dress. Then, the other woman also got on her knees, and the two embraced in a hug.
A post shared by DI PETSA üåä (@dipetsa)
It also appeared that both had what seemed like red paint across two fingers, perhaps representing blood.
The performance concluded with the two models strutting down to the end of the runway hand in hand.

The Greek designer later took the catwalk to read a poem,‚Äúgoddess muses,‚Äù about her Fall/Winter 2024 creations:¬†
Frame the chaos of my body
Flesh against metal¬†
Silver Bells vibrate on my Skin
I close my eyes¬†
Mary and Venus¬†
And
My breast filled up for you¬†
Warm Pain¬†
Warm Pain¬†
Di Petsa‚Äôs designs are far from being the only eccentric ensembles showcased at London Fashion Week. Over the years, people have seen show-stopping looks that capture designer‚Äôs creativity and desire to push the boundaries of fashion.
For instance, the London brand On/Off presented its Sesame Street Collaboration in 2019 that featured a yellow feathery coat paired with a furry bright orange hat, which was clearly inspired by Big Bird.

The same year, a model walked the runway at the San Kim fashion show during the Men‚Äôs June 2019 London Fashion Week in strange denim cut-out overalls with a peculiar design on the crotch area.¬†
To accompany the outfit, the man wore white sandals and what seemed like blue inflatable gloves that almost completely covered his arms.

On a different catwalk, a design by Geo Legate during the 2019 Sheffield Hallam University show at Graduate Fashion Week consisted of a black, red, and yellow catsuit paired with two green hands with painted nails hanging from the model‚Äôs abdomen.¬†
The male model held a third fabric hand and had a green piece of fabric across his shoulders.

Another show-stopping look from Graduate Fashion Week was seen during the GFW collective show at The Truman Brewery in London. On that occasion, the model appeared on the catwalk with his full body covered, except for his face, in over a dozen shirts sewn together.

While some considered these looks to be stylish and said that they celebrated the designers‚Äô talent and guts to create something different, others focused on the eccentric nature of the creations, labeling them ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù or comparing them to costume designs seen in movies.

 As a visual editor in the News team, I look for the most interesting pictures and comments to make each post interesting and informative through images, so that you aren't reading only blocks of text. I joined Bored Panda not that long ago, but in this short amount of time I have covered a wide range of topics: from true crime to Taylor Swift memes (my search history is very questionable because of that).In my freetime, I enjoy spending time at the gym, gaming, binging Great British Bake Off and adding yet another tattoo artist that I would love to get a tattoo from to my pinterest board.

The problem is that it should not be labeled as fashion but modern art project
It's avant-garde. Which is more of an artistic expression through fashion. It's not designed to be sold as everyday clothing, it's basically an art show.
agree
Never üòù people just need to under the difference between couture, avant garde and everyday /wearable fashions tbh and stop annoying the artist about how to design. The wet look one is very in tune with historical fashions jn England, I picked it before entering this article
Yeah but what if it's been a long and storied tradition to be an absolute hater about this stuff sometimes? Come on, the one with the hands. Come on.
I agree with you. I don't know why you're being downvoted. This is avant garde, everyone in the comments thinking the designer wants to ship out thousands of these to their local retailer.
And.probably still don't have pockets
That would be way too weird lol
This is like the concept car shows. Weird ideas that will never meet the outside world.
