After weeks of speculation, iHeartMedia has officially announced Jess Hilarious as the new co-host of The Breakfast Club.
Jess and Charlamagne announced her getting the coveted job on Jan. 29 by sharing the same video on their Instagram pages.
“To Whom It May Concern,” Charlamagne’s post read.
It included a video montage of sound clips from various podcasts and social media posts in recent weeks that speculated if Jess was joining the morning show after an initial announcement that seemingly produced no results.

Power 105.1 followed up with an official statement from Jess and an iHeartMedia exec confirming the announcement.
“I’m looking forward to joining forces with one of the largest media platforms,” Jess Hilarious said. “I’m confident that taking the third seat at The Breakfast Club will show people that Jess Hilarious is not just comedy, but culture.”
The media company’s VP of programming supported the decision, following a year of rotating guest hosts where Jess remained a clear standout.
“I’m very excited to have Jess Hilarious join The Breakfast Club. She is a force in her own right, an actress, comedian, podcaster, and now, the co-host of The Breakfast Club,” Thea Mitchem, iHeartMedia Executive Vice President of Programming said. 
“Jess was the standout choice to join Charlamagne and DJ Envy to build upon The Breakfast Club’s legacy of entertaining, informing and enlightening the community.”
It was late last month when Jess was first announced as the new co-host. She made the announcement at a holiday party in her hometown of Baltimore.

However, in the days and weeks that followed, no official announcement was made and many started to speculate if the offer was rescinded. Most recently, Jess posted a rant on social media that called Charlamagne and DJ Envy “trash” for their comparison of SZA to Mary J. Blige. The post left many wondering if Jess was confirming that she would no longer be a co-host on the show.

But, it might’ve all been a part of a bigger marketing plan as Jess shared another video post highlighting the official photoshoot she had with her new co-workers Charlamagne and Envy.
“I wanted to be on The Breakfast Club. Who wouldn’t want to be third co-host on a hall-of-fame show,” Jess says at the start of the video.
