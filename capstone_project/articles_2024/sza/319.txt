	Six years after her debut album, Cardi B is finally giving fans the sophomore project they have been begging for. The Bronx star is kicking her album rollout into full gear with the announcement of her forthcoming single “Enough (Miami).” The track is slated to arrive this Friday (March 15) and is a close follow-up to “Like What (Freestyle)” from the top of this month. 

	The “Bodak Yellow” spitter revealed “Enough (Miami)” by sharing the official cover art and release date on her social media. The seductive image shows Cardi laying on a white satin bed with no clothes on, as her long, thick tresses cascade down on one side.

	Cardi also posted a preview of an unreleased track, which is most likely “Enough (Miami)” due to the references to the city she makes in the verse.

	“I could survive in the coldest conditions/ B**ches is washed, soap in the dishes/ I apply pressure like boa constrictors/ One b**ch, two b**ch, old b**ch, new b**ch/ None of y’all b**ches not gon’ do sh*t/ I’m in Miami, I pull up on cruise ships/ You in Miami, four h**s to a room sh*t,” she raps in the clip over an OG Parker-produced instrumental.

	Prior to “Like What (Freestyle),” the mother-of-two dropped off “Bongos” with Megan Thee Stallion in September of last year. The duo previously collaborated on “WAP” in 2020, which has since gone 8x Platinum. 

	Outside of her own releases, the New York City native has stayed active by delivering a number of impressive guest features. She has made appearances on tracks like “Wild Side” by Normani, “Rumors” with Lizzo, “No Love” with Summer Walker and SZA, “Put It On Da Floor Again” by Latto, and “Jealousy” by Offset.
