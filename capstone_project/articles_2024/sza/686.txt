Made In America won’t be taking place in 2024 after festival organizers announced the event’s cancellation for a second consecutive year. 

	The festival released a statement to social media on Wednesday (April 3), simply saying that their executive production team is “reimagining a live music experience” and promising an “exciting return” in the future. “Since its inception, this groundbreaking festival has celebrated music & community – from creating a space for fans to connect, to uplifting local small businesses & shining a light on important causes,” the statement read. It has strived for accessibility, eliminating barriers through affordable tickets and location.”

	Made In America has been a Labor Day Weekend staple since being founded by Jay-Z in 2012. The festival was hosted at Philadelphia’s Ben Franklin Parkway annually, only skipping 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic before canceling 2023’s edition.

	Last year, festival organizers pulled the plug on Made In America in August 2023, one month before showtime. At the time, organizers said the event was being cancelled due to “severe circumstances outside of production control” following a period of “immense deliberation” on their behalf.

	2023’s show featured SZA and Lizzo as headliners and was also scheduled to feature a joint set by Mase and Cam’ron, as well as performances by Miguel, Tems, Ice Spice, Metro Boomin, Doechii, Coi Leray, Latto, Lola Brooke, Coco Jones, Lil Yachty and more. 

	At the time, organizers also promised a return in 2024 — however, Made in America had not yet released an official lineup for the 2024 edition of the festival.
