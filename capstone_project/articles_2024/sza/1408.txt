Jelly Roll can't wait to get in the studio with GloRilla. The Nashville artist was clearly impressed with Big Glo's debut album Glorious. He took to X on Monday, October 14 to personally praise her work and make a request for her next project. "Yoooo @GloTheofficial your album is amazing - please put me on the next one," he wrote. "I know we kept barely missing each other in LA but the next one we gotta lock in. So happy for you and your success . You deserve all the good coming your way. Praying for y’all and sending love."
"Thx so much ❤️❤️❤️," she replied. "hell yea you going on da next one lol we gotta go up fa Tennessee one time !!!!!!🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼"This isn't the first time Jelly Roll has expressed his appreciation for his fellow Tennessee native. During his time at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards in April, the Beautifully Broken singer told Tanya Rad and EJ that he was excited to meet GloRilla while on the yellow carpet. He also said GloRilla and SZA would be “awesome” artists to collaborate with. “GloRilla’s here!" he said at the time. "I’m so excited to meet GloRilla. I got so many people here that I’m fans of. Justin Timberlake’s here. Cher is here. I mean, what a night, dude. I’m like a fly on a bull’s butt! You know what I mean? This is a big deal, dude!”Jelly Roll has been blurring the lines between Hip-Hop and Country for years so a collaboration between him and Glo would sound incredible. Let's hope they finally find the time to link up in the studio!
