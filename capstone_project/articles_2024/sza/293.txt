Did you know this gold medalist was from WA State?
She's been spotted at all the "It Girl" spots in Hollywood and even in Paris, where she competed for the US Women's Gymnastics Olympic team.
Her latest feat is a spot in the coveted Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, where she wore a Tyne swimsuit!
Jordan has been a member of the United States Women’s Gymnastics Team since 2013.
She was born in Tualatin, Oregon, in 2001, but grew up and trained in Washington State.
She has trained alongside Simone Biles!
She has won silver, bronze, and gold medals at the Olympics.
Jordan grew up in Vancouver and trained at Naydenov Gymnastics.

Want some tight and defined abs? Jordan's gymnastic workouts during practice help keep her core strong. I have a "one-pack" Mom Bod, so I guess I should go work on some ab crunches!
That sounds like something I don't want am not able to do yet. What is a "Superman Hold" anyway?
Pop Sugar Fitness details Jordan's at-home ab workout, which consists of Hollow pulses and holds, V-ups, and more.
Dancing is a perfect way to add some cardio to your workout, and this TikTok video posted by Jordan "Baby Jo" Chiles herself shows her doing some fun dance moves with her friend and fellow Olympian, Suni Lee. Jordan's fave music to dance to often includes "Megan Thee Stallion, Beyoncé, SZA, H.E.R., Drake, and Lil Baby."
Jordan uses Epsom salt baths as a way to ease away all those toxins. I love doing that, too, including going to float spas!
