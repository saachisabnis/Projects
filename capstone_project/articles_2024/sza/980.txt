I was thinking of Billie with AOTY and perhaps Sabrina with Pop Vocal Album but it seems to be a disappointment. Billie is weak in Pop but maybe she will sweep this year ? 
I could see Chappell winning BPVA and Billie winning AOTY tbh. BPVA normally goes to either the album with the most hits (which this year I feel like all of the frontrunners have a comparable amount so far), or the one that explodes at the right moment and Chappell is blowing up like crazy. She’s got 6 album tracks charting right now (plus Good Luck, Babe!). Also this is fully random, but Hot To Go is being used as the promo song for VMA commercials and weirdly the last few promo songs for the VMAs were Karma by Taylor Swift, Late Night Talking by Harry Styles, and Brutal by Olivia Rodrigo, which all happened to be the artists that won the next BPVA award.
“Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time”
My personal picks if I were a voter:
AOTY: Scarlet 2 Claude (Deluxe)
ROTY: Die With a Smile
SOTY: Die With a Smile
BNA: Shaboozey
Pop Solo: Too Sweet
Pop Duo/Group: Die With a Smile/Now and Then (tie)
Rap Performance: Not Like Us
Melodic Rap: Agora Hills
Rap Song: Not Like Us
Rap Album: Scarlet 2 Claude (Deluxe)
Music Video: Now and Then

Honey, you girls claimed Sabrina Crapenter was winning Best Pop Vocal Album.  Now, y’all are changing up.  NOT surprised her album is trash.
Even if Sabrina’s album was critically acclaimed she was never beating Billie Eilish so o don’t see what the commotion is for. Pop Vocal Album is really a no brainer. Hit Me Hard and Soft is taking it quite easily. 
AOTY – Kaytranada – Timeless
ROTY – Doja Cat “Agora Hills”
SOTY – “Birds of a Feather” (Billie Eilish)
BNA – Sabrina Carpenter 🤣
Pop Solo – Espresso
Pop Duo – Charli XCX & Lorde – girl so confusing
Pop Vocal Album – Hit Me Hard and Soft
Dance Pop Recording – Got Me Started – Troye Sivan
Dance Electronic Album – Brat
R&B Performance – Lucky Daye – HERicane
R&B Song – “Nasty” (Tinashe)
R&B Album – Algorithm (Lucky Daye)
Traditional R&B – Chlöe x Halle – Want Me
Prog R&B Album – Kaytranada – Timeless
Rap Song – Agora Hills
Rap Performance – Not Like Us
Melodic Rap Perf – Agora Hills
Rap Album – For All the Dogs 🤭
only picking from likely nominees
AOTY: Only God Was Above Us
ROTY: Good Luck, Babe
SOTY: Birds of a Feather
BNA: Chappell Roan
BPSP: Birds of a Feather
BPDG: Girl, so confusing
BPVA: The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess
although if I were an actual voter I’d vote for Bey in AOTY for… obvious reasons
Beyoncé is coming !

she did not come
Honey, unlike 2021 and 2023, Beyoncé will NOT be winning 4 Grammys in 2025.  Homegirl will only win 1-2 genre categories.
Beyoncé is coming !
For your 2026 Grammy consideration
Best Dance/Electronic Album:
Anti Up - What Is Life
Zed’s Dead - Return to the Spectrum of Intergalactic Happiness 
Best Dance/Electronic Recording:
Anyma & Ellie Goulding - “Hypnotized”
Sub Focus featuring Katy B - “Push The Tempo”
Zeds Dead - “One of These Mornings”
Die With a Smile from #15 to #1 on Spotify’s TTH. I’m surprised it didn’t go to Sabrina.
Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars’ “Die With A Smile” is #1 on Spotify’s Today’s Top Hits playlist. pic.twitter.com/5T70rnidLF

Migs
Taste > Please Please Please. I think I like it more than Espresso? With this one, it feels like she found her own sound, unlike Espresso which sounds too similar to Say So.
SHORT N SWEET – 8/10
Favs: Bed Chem, Taste, Please x3, Expresso, Good Graces, Juno, Don’t Smile & Dumb and Poetic
