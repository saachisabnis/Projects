	The group comprised of Jongseob, Theo, Soul, Jiung, Intak and Keeho kicked off the run of dates on May 14 in Houston and hit Dallas, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, Washington, D.C, Atlanta, Nashville, Miami, New York (as part of Governors Ball) and Oakland before wrapping up on June 16 in Los Angeles.

	They, of course, took advantage of their time in the U.S., with Keeho saying that on off days he loves to soak up as much culture as he can. “I love to go out. I love to be really immersed in the city I’m in,” he said of his days-off activities. “I like to try out food, go shopping and see sites.” In Miami, he says he went out to Miami Beach and got dinner by himself, gently ribbing his bandmates for not answering his text request to join him on his adventures.

	He also recalls that in Nashville — where the group played at the Grand Ole Opry — he and Intak were at a mall and they spotted five or six fans who recognized them and were wearing their merch. “We love see our fans out in the wild,” he says. “They’re all super nice and respectful.”

	Though they’re a bit tired from the travel, Jiung says that they are ready and excited to hit the ground when they return to Seoul this week. “We have a lot of festivals and we’re always preparing the new album or new songs, new performances,” he says. 

	The group say they were overjoyed by their chance to play the Governors Ball in New York, with Intak saying in Korean that it was “an honor to see new artists perform and show them our performance at the same time, which is an opportunity that doesn’t come very often.” Keeho added he loved seeing sets by artists they respect and are inspired by, including SZA and Don Toliver.

	They also discussed their upcoming second visit to K-CON in Los Angeles (July 26-28), with Keeho getting geeked for the 360 performance stage at Crypto Arena in which they are surrounded by their fans. “It’s alway so cool to perform because you can see everyone everywhere,” he says. “Coming back as even more refined and better artists than before and being able to show the audience how much we improved.” P1HARMONY released their full-length debut, Killin’ It, in February.

	










	In addition, the group touched on being “nervous and honored” to throw out the first pitch at a Chicago Cubs game, with Keeho revealing that Theo had never thrown a baseball before and was up all night beforehand searching YouTube for how-to videos on pitching. Check out the video above to find out what the group thought of their first visit to the ACM Awards — where they got to meet one of their favorites, Post Malone, and take a pic with the singer — as well as how they feel about making social content with fellow K-pop idols TOMORROW X TOGETHER and Zerobaseone.
