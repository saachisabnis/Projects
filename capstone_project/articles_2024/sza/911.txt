Kai points out that he understands how people end up going broke, stating, "It's the small habits you need to break before they turn into bigger problems." He went on to explain, "It's a bad habit to throw things on the counter," emphasizing that he has never behaved that way. Kai also added, "All you have to do is ask," expressing that he simply wants clarity on what he's purchasing.
