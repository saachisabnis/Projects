The singer, whose new release, ‘Lana,’ is eagerly anticipated by fans, addressed the subject on her personal X account on January 6th.
“Leaking my music is stealing,” she wrote. “This is my job. This is my life and my intellectual property. You are a f-cking thief and I promise to put maximum energy into holding everyone accountable to the full extent of the law. I am tired.”
SZA first announced ‘Lana’ back in September, describing it as the deluxe version of her latest album ‘SOS’, which was released in December 2022.
