The hip-hop superstars join forces for a 19-date North American tour this spring and summer.
Prolific California rapper Kendrick Lamar has just released an outstanding surprise album, GNX, and today he adds to the excitement around it with the announcement of a 2025 stadium tour that comes to The Linc on May 5th.
The album’s complexity, versatility and power is incredible, however he isn’t alone on this run, as he is joined by the celebrated singer SZA. The two have collaborated many times over the years — on “Doves in the Wind” from SZA’s debut album CTRL, on “All The Stars” from Kendrick’s soundtrack to Black Panther — and they are collaborating yet again, with SZA featuring on two songs on GNX (“Luther” and “Gloria”) and with this tour where the two stars will perform all over the country.
The tour starts April 19th in Minneapolis, and will continue through the spring and summer, ending June 18th in Washington D.C. May 5th, however, is where the two will perform in Philadelphia, for an outdoor concert at Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles. Pre-sale tickets are officially available Wednesday, December 4th, at 10 am. The general sale is open Friday, December 6th at 10 am, at grandnationaltour.com.
