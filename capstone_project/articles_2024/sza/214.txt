Sexyy Red was relatively unknown to most rap fans not long ago. Her breakthrough occurred less than a year ago with her track "Pound Town 2," featuring Nicki Minaj, gaining momentum. This success led to "Skee Yee" becoming a popular TikTok hit last summer and paved the way for high-profile collaborations. Notably, she achieved her biggest hit to date with Drake and SZA on "Rich Baby Daddy." Her latest solo release, "Get It Sexyy," made the highest chart debut she has seen so far. Despite the rapid rise to fame, recent online posts showing Red before her fame, without her recognizable tattoos and red hair, have left fans impressed. Comments on the post praised her previous appearance, with one remarking, "I been told n*ggas sexy actually fine," and another suggesting, "She looked better wtf." 
Red has also become entangled in a major rap beef, as Kendrick Lamar mentioned her in his track "euphoria," a response to Drake. Kendrick's lyrics jokingly target Drake's connection to Red. Tay Keith, an early supporter of Red, faced unexpected criticism for collaborating with her during her swift ascent to fame. Keep it locked to 103.5 The Beat for more.
