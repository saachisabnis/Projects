Dreamville Festival 2024 could go down as the most newsworthy edition in the history of the J. Cole-founded music event. The Dreamville Records frontman made headlines for his polarizing on-stage speech about his collaborator-turned-rival Kendrick Lamar.
In addition, the fourth Dreamville Festival turned out to be a huge success for the record label. More than 100,000 festival-goers reportedly attended the two-day outdoor celebration at Raleigh, North Carolina’s Dorothea Dix Park.
The 2024 Dreamville Festival featured performances by J. Cole, Nicki Minaj, SZA, 50 Cent, Lil Durk, Jeezy, Central Cee, ScHoolboy Q, Sexyy Red, Benny The Butcher, 6lack, Lil Yachty and more acts. Dreamville signees J.I.D, Bas, EarthGang, Cozz, Omen and Lute also made appearances.
“No one puts on like Dreamville fans,” Dreamville co-founder and Festival President Adam Roy states. “We are grateful to everyone from around the world who continue to rock with us year after year after year, while our team continues to find new ways to elevate and improve the festival-going experience in all facets.”
Adam Roy also adds, “Thank you to Raleigh, to North Carolina, to our community partners and city stakeholders, and to the tens of thousands of individuals who helped produce this event.”
