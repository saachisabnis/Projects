Kim Gordon, The Vaccines, Lambrini Girls and more have been added to the line-up
Glastonbury has announced the stacked line-up for the Woodsies Area, with artists including Kim Gordon and The Vaccines being added to the bill.
The Worthy Farm festival shared its official 2024 line-up for Glastonbury last month– with Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA confirmed as headlining the iconic Pyramid Stage this summer, while Shania Twain performs in the legends slot on the Sunday.
In the time since, organisers have been counting down the weeks to this year’s instalment by gradually announcing the artists playing at other stages around the site. This kicked off with news of new artists set to headline the Acoustic Stage, followed by details on those who have joined the Field Of Avalon line-up, Shangri-La area, Fields of Avalon, Silver Hayes, The Glade and more.
Now, the stacked line-up for the Woodsies area has been revealed, with a host of artists being added to the bill.
Joining previously revealed artists Jamie xx, Romy, James Blake and Sleaford Mods is ‘90s alt-rock legend and former Sonic Youth icon, Kim Gordon, who recently dropped her critically acclaimed second solo album, ‘The Collective’.
Also joining the listing for the 2024 Woodsies stage includes The Vaccines, as well as Lambrini Girls, Voice of Baceprot and The K’s. For the latter, the slot at Glasto arrives after they gave The Libertines a run for their money earlier this month by securing the Number Two slot in the UK charts with debut album ‘I Wonder If The World Knows?’.
“We’re over the moon to be playing Glastonbury for the first time ever,” the band wrote on X/Twitter, sharing the news. “Catch us on the Woodsies stage – in the North West Corner of the festival between Pyramid and Silver Hayes. Bucket list stuff – see you there”.

Others confirmed for the stage are Declan McKenna, Yard Act, Arlo Parks, Fat White Family, Blondshell, Soccer Mommy, NewDad, Mannequin Pussy, Kneecap and more.
Emerging artist JayaHadADream has also been added to the line-up following her winning the festival’s 2024 Emerging Talent Competition and securing a coveted slot at this year’s event.
The Nottingham-based rapper won over a judging panel – including Glasto boss Emily Eavis, industry professionals and Glastonbury main stage bookers – with her high-energy thought-provoking hip-hop.
“It feels completely surreal also heartwarming and reassuring,” she said after the win. “There are so many emerging artists doing amazing things, so to feel this seen and heard in such a busy climate is incredible, especially in hip-hop where women are so underrepresented.”
Alongside the mainstage at Woodsies, the line-up for the smaller Tree Stage in the area has also been revealed, and will be featuring performances from The Orb, Ana Roxanne, KMRI, Klein, Bea Brennan and more. Check out the complete list of artists in the poster below.

In the run up to the 2023 edition of the festival, Glasto organisers also announced a brand new stage dedicated to South Asian talent as part of the Shangri-La area, with Bobby Friction, Anish Kumar, Nabihah Iqbal and Nikki Nair as part of its lineup.
The Acoustic Stage was confirmed just days before, and is set to see Scouting For Girls, Stornoway, Ocean Colour Scene, Angie McMahon, and Red Hot Chili Peppers‘ cover band, Red Hot Chilli Pipers perform, as well as Russell Crowe’s Indoor Garden Party. The latter particularly caught the attention of festival-goers, with many taking to social media to share their thoughts on the Gladiator actor being added to the bill.
This year’s instalment will run between June 26 and June 30. Visit here for the full line-up and stage splits for Glastonbury 2024 so far.
