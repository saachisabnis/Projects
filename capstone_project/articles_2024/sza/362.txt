The news follows the announcement of the special guests for SZA‘s headline show last week. The R&B singer will top the bill at the summer concert series on Saturday June 29 – the day before she headlines Glastonbury (Sunday June 30). It was previously confirmed that she’ll be joined in the capital by Sampha and Snoh Aalegra and more recently, the acts completing the bill were confirmed as Elmiene, No Guidnce, Sekou, Hope Tala, Fabiana Palladino, Nia Smith and Jessy Blakemore.
Also headlining BST Hyde Park this summer are Kings Of Leon (June 30), Morgan Wallen (July 4) Andrea Bocelli (July 5), Robbie Williams (July 6), Shania Twain (July 7), Stevie Nicks (July 12) and Stray Kids (July 14).
In other Kylie news, the artist hinted at a possible collaboration with Madonna after their recent appearance on stage together on one night of Madonna’s ‘Celebration’ tour. Joining forces for International Women’s Day, they sang a rendition of Minogue’s hit 2001 song ‘Can’t Get You Out Of My Head’, as well as Gloria Gaynor’s girl-power anthem ‘I Will Survive’.
Speaking to Variety at the Vanity Fair Oscars party on March 10, the Australian fielded a question about the possibility of the two artists working on a studio collaboration together.
“Maybe. Who knows? Let’s see,” she responded, tantalisingly.
“Now, this is what we call survival,” Madonna said during the gig, wearing a leather jacket and cowboy boots. “It’s a privilege for me to be up here singing with you… God bless you, never give up.”
