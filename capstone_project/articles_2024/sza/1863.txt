Another day, another leaked track hits the internet.
This weekend, tracks that are believed to be a part of SZA’s forthcoming SOS deluxe, otherwise known as LANA, hit the internet. As expected, the New Jersey native was not pleased after learning that her work had hit the internet before she was prepared to release it.
“Leaking my music is stealing. This is my job. This is my life and my intellectual property. You are a f*cking thief and I promise to put maximum energy into holding everyone accountable to the full extent of the law. I am tired,” she tweeted on Saturday, January 6.
“On some g sh*t, I [don’t] bother n*ggas. I make my lil’ songs and go on my lil’ hikes and watch memes. Shake a lil’ a** from time to time and pop sh*t on wax. There is no reason for sh*t to be this weird,” she added in a separate tweet.
The GRAMMY Award-winning act from Maplewood, New Jersey has dealt with leaked music previously. In fact, she addressed the issue during an interview with Jem Aswad of Variety in November.
“When people leak my songs, they ruin them,” she told the publication.
“Then it’s not mine anymore; it’s actually yours. It’s something unfinished that you decided was ready to be shared.”
On a brighter note, SZA is currently riding the success of her most recent LP, SOS. The project earned her more nominations at the 66th Annual GRAMMY Awards than any other artist. Not to mention, she recently wrapped of her latest tour, covered Rolling Stone and performed alongside Jay Rock at the 10th annual TDE Christmas Giveback. To top it all off, she recently celebrated her grandmother’s birthday.
