The festival founder broke out classics by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley to open the Park Stage
Michael Eavis has made his first public appearance at Glastonbury 2024 today (Thursday June 27), performing classic songs from Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra on the Park Stage. Find photos of the moment below.
The festival co-founder, now aged 88, has made it an annual tradition to perform a brief set on the eve of Glasto, and break out several old-school hits with a backing band to warm up the stage ahead of the weekend.
This time, he appeared on The Park at 4.30pm in a wheelchair and performed with his band. They broke out three Sinatra tracks – ‘Love’s Been Good To Me’, ‘It Was A Very Good Year’ and ‘My Way’.
He also closed the set with an extended version of Presley’s 1969 hit ‘Suspicious Minds’, with the crowd chanting his name and swaying their arms in unison. Check out fan-captured images of the set below.

His set marked the first time that he has taken to the stage since receiving a knighthood from King Charles earlier this year.
He was among a host of stars including Shirley Bassey, Ridley Scott, Leona Lewis and Emilia Clarke who were recognised by the monarch in April, and the honour came following him being given a CBE in 2007.
Eavis hosted the first edition of the festival on Worthy Farm in Somerset in 1970. Since it began, it has become the largest greenfield festival in the world and draws in an annual pull of around 200,000 people, as well as some of the biggest names in music. Check out the story of the first ever Glastonbury here.
This year’s edition of the legendary festival kicked off yesterday (June 26) and is set to run until Sunday (June 30), with the Pyramid Stage headliners being Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA. Other confirmed acts include Shania Twain, LCD Soundsystem, Little Simz, Jungle, Justice, Bloc Party, Yard Act, Arlo Parks and Gossip. There are also rumours of a secret Coldplay gig nearby.
At the start of the month, organisers revealed the full line-up, stage splits and timings for the sold-out bash – including some new names and various ‘TBA’ secret slots. The BBC has also shared its extensive coverage plans for the huge weekend of music.

The merchandise for the artists has also been spotted around the site, with the majority of designs currently being for Twain – who will be filling this year’s Legend’s slot.
Meanwhile, the bookies’ odds have been published for who might be playing a secret set at Worthy Farm this year – and bets have been suspended on one huge artist already.
