As the week in music comes to a close, Hypebeast has rounded up the best projects for the latest installment of Best New Tracks.
This week’s lineup is led by J. Cole, SZA and Smino, who dropped the preview of a track via a vlog entitled “Might Delete Later, Vol. 1,” “Saturn” and “TBA.” Also joining this selection are offerings from Khruangbin, EARTHGANG, Free Nationals with Anderson .Paak and A$AP Rocky, Strick with Young Thug and James Blake, SiR with Isaiah Rashad, MGMT, Bu Cuaron and Erick the Architect.
J. Cole continues to tease his upcoming album The Fall Off with the preview of a song in a vlog entitled Might Delete Later Vol. 1. The cut is sandwiched in the middle of the nine-minute vlog that sees Cole and Drake’s ongoing tour, as well his studio sessions with the likes of Tay Keith and link ups with Lil Durk.
