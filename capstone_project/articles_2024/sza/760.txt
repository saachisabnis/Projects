UPDATE (April 19):
Drake released the song on DSPs on April 19 with the title "Push Ups."
ORIGINAL STORY (April 13):
An unconfirmed Drake diss track hit social media on Saturday (April 13), and fans have been in a frenzy over it. The song features Drake aiming his acidic bars at Kendrick Lamar, but also Future, Metro Boomin, Rick Ross and The Weeknd. The track is apparently produced by Boi-1da and 40, and features a soundbite of DJ Akademiks on the interlude. There are two different versions of the song floating around since it hasn't officially been released yet. The initial version features a sample of Junior M.A.F.I.A's 1995 classic "Get Money." A second version of the track has the original beat replaced with another. That song is being played on iHeartRadio stations.
Here are the lyrics in full for the first leaked version of Drake's diss track.

Lyrically, Drizzy didn't hold back and took shots at his rap rivals, mainly K-Dot. Here's a breakdown of The 6 God's lyrics on the diss track.
"I could never be nobody number one fan/Your first number one, I had to put it in your hand/You p***ies can't get booked outside America for nan/I'm out in Tokyo because I'm big in Japan"
"I'm the hitmaker y'all depend on/Tough on record, in my city, it was friend zone/You won't ever take no chain off of us/How the f**k you big steppin' with a size 7 men's on?/This the bark with the bite, n***a, what's up?/I know my picture on the wall when y'all cook up/Extortion baby, whole career you been shook up/'Cause Top told you drop and give me 50 like some push-ups, huh"
"Your last one bricked, you really not on s**t/They make excuses for you 'cause they hate to see me lit/Pull your contract 'cause we gotta see the split/The way you doin' splits, b***h, your pants might rip/ You better do that muthaf**kin' show inside the bitty/Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty/Then we need a verse for the Swifties/Top say drop, you better drop and give 'em 50"
"Pipsqueak, pipe down/You ain't in no Big 3, SZA got you wiped down/Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down/Like your label, boy, you in the scope right now/And you gon' feel the aftermath of what I write down/I'm at the top of the mountain, so you tight now/Just to have this talk with yo' a*s, I had to hike down/Big difference between Mike then and Mike now/What the f**k is this, a twenty-V-one, n***a?/What's a prince to a king? He a son, n***a"
"Get more love in the city that you from, n***a/Metro, shut your ho a*s up and make some drums, n***a"
"Claim the 6ix, and you boys ain't even come from it/And when you boys got rich, you had to run from it/Cash blowin' Abel bread, out here trickin'/S**t we do for b***hes he doin' for n***as"
"I might take your latest girl and cuff her like I'm Ricky/Can't believe he jumpin' in, this n***a turnin' 50/Every song that made it on the chart, he got from Drizzy/Worry 'bout whatever goin' on with you and 'Huh!'"
