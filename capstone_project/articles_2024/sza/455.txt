Black excellence took center stage on Sunday, March 3, as the talented teams and loved ones behind some of Hollywood’s most revered talent were honored in a very special way.
As founder Trell Thomas continues to gather a who’s who in the entertainment space, this event, titled “To be Celebrated,” is an extension of his signature event, The Black Excellence Brunch. “To Be Celebrated” honors the gifted individuals behind the celebrities for their hard work behind the scenes. On Sunday, Emmy Award winners Niecy Nash and Tabitha Brown, along with acclaimed actress Kyla Pratt, honored those who have been vital parts of their success.
Nash celebrated her wife, Jessica Betts; while Tabitha Brown celebrated her longtime glam team, Brandie King and Shaylin Jones. Grammy Award-winning artist SZA joined the festivities via recorded message to celebrate her creative director-choreographer Cortland James, and Kyla Pratt celebrated her mother, Kecia Pratt, for her unwavering support throughout her career.
“It meant a lot for me to be here today,” said Pratt. “I love events like this where we can all come together. I’m all about showing love and to be around so many people who are great at what they do … there was no BS in the building! Being able to honor my mom was amazing. I’m a mother, so now I understand fully wanting to be perfect and I accept my mother for everything she’s ever done for me and my siblings. I appreciate her, she is an inspiration, and to see her growth into the woman she is now is an inspiration.”
Additional attendees included NAACP Image Award-nominated husband and wife, Angel Moore and Marcus Tanksley, actress Kellee Stewart, Emmy-nominated choreographers Tia Rivera and Adrian DJ Dubs, actor-influencer Kendall Kyndall and creative director Joey Harris. The event was powered by Don Julio Tequila.
