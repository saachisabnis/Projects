Earlier this year, BET Media Group CEO Scott Mills spoke to Billboard about Fan Fest’s return after a nearly five-year hiatus. “We are proud to reintroduce BET Experience in the vibrant city of Los Angeles to celebrate the best of Black culture and entertainment,” he said. “BETX 2024 is set to deliver an unprecedented week of entertainment, engagement, and empowerment, all anchored in the brilliance and creativity of Black culture and our community.”
The company’s president of media sales, Louis Carr, added, “Historically, BETX has been a core part of our brand success, offering bespoke opportunities for our partners to join our celebration of Black culture and directly engage with consumers and multiple segments of the Black community in meaningful, impactful ways.”
The 2024 BET Awards will take place on June 30. Drake led the nominations with seven nods, while Nicki Minaj followed with six. Trailing behind the “FTCU” rapper were J. Cole, Sexyy Red, SZA, and Victoria Monét, who each had five.
GloRilla, Latto, Muni Long, Shaboozey, Monét, and Red were among the performers announced for this year’s event.
