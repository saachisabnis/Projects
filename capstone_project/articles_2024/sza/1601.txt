GLENDALE, AZ (AP/AZFamily) — “Not Like Us,” it’s like them — Kendrick Lamar and SZA will hit the road together in 2025.
On Tuesday morning, Lamar and SZA announced the Grand National Tour, which will hit 19 stadiums across North America next spring and summer.
The tour is scheduled to come to State Farm Stadium in Glendale on May 27.
The news arrives less than two weeks after Lamar released his latest album, “GNX,” which features SZA on two tracks: “Luther” and the closer “Gloria.” In a review, AP described the album as leaning into the same creativity-juicing pride, self-righteous anger and supreme confidence that fueled the Grammy-nominated “Not Like Us” and won his feud with Drake: “I kill ‘em all before I let ’em kill my joy.”
The tour kicks off on April 19 in Minneapolis and ends on June 18 Washington, D.C.
Tickets go on sale Friday. A pre-sale for Cash App Visa Card holders will launch a day earlier.
