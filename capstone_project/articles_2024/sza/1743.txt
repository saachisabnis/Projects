	The Grammy winner opened up about the collaboration in an interview with Nylon. “I just picked what I would generally wear,” she said of choosing her favorite styles. “My mom always told me that wearing sunglasses blocks people from seeing your energy and from connecting with you. I didn’t grow up wearing a lot of them, but now they’re so fun. I’m learning how to accessorize them, how to add them to my personality. I tried to basically pick ones I would generally wear.”

	










	Her favorite Quay sunnies are the On Set visor sunglasses. “They’re so cute. I [also] feel like a classic Inspector Gadget, like a slim, black pair, that’s another great shape where I feel it’s fire for day and night. You can go formal, to secretive, to secret agent, to also sexy. It’s divine.”

	SZA will have plenty of chances to show off her favorite Quay shades. After taking her SOS Tour to Australia and New Zealand last month, SZA is back Stateside to take the stage at Sol Blume Music Festival in Sacramento, Calif., on May 5.

	She’s also billed to co-headline Jack Harlow’s Gazebo Festival held later this month, Governors Ball next month and Lollapalooza in August. Get tickets here.
