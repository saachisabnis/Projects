This week's best beauty Instagrams saw the stars on our feeds finding their 2024 footing. For SZA, that translated to ensuring a healthy balance of glam and adventure, her beauty notes ranging from a blowout and exaggerated manicure to a naturally textured crop and butterfly-bedecked pedicure. Amanda Seyfried snapped a selfie with a featured friend, as elsewhere, Camila Medes showed off a vampy red manicure with the help of a furry companion. 
“Too glam to give a damn,” captioned a pouting Kim Kardashian, over-lined nude lips (a signature technique of makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic) paired with a full-tilt smokey eye, her want of drama countered by Tracee Ellis Ross's minimalist beat. And for makeup artist Jo Baker, the kickstart of award season called for a diary-style documentation of her own self-care process—the better to prepare to create some of the evening's most noteworthy red carpet looks. Here, the best beauty moments of the week, as seen on Instagram.
