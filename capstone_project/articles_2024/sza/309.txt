TV personality and professional dancer Amanda Kloots is one of the first to arrive on the red carpet of the 66th Annual Grammy Awards at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. The blonde beauty co-host from The Talk is turning heads in a skintight red sequin catsuit and matching stilettos. 
Kloots turned heads at the Clive Davis pre-Grammys party too,  as seen below in a tiny strapless mini dress with a silver lining by fashion designer Lee Petra Grebenau.
