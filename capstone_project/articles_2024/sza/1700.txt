Taylor Swift had the most nominations, with 10. She was followed by Post Malone‘s nine. All of Malone’s nominations except one are for his collaboration with Swift, “Fortnight.”
Em’s half-dozen noms, except for Artist of the Year, are all for his video “Houdini.” Lamar scored a nomination for Song of the Year for his Drake diss “Not Like Us;” while his opponent got two nominations for his collab with Sexyy Red and SZA, “Rich Baby Daddy.”

Drizzy’s song is also nominated for Best Hip-Hop, along with “Houdini,” GloRilla‘s “Yeah Glo!” Gunna‘s “fukumean,” Megan Thee Stallion‘s “BOA” and Travis Scott and Playboi Carti‘s “FE!N.”
Despite sharing the same honor in different years, Megan Thee Stallion and Nicki Minaj have been feuding for quite some time.

On her late-June album Megan, the Houston rapper fired several shots at her fierce rival.
Meg wasted little time in rekindling their feud, appearing to take aim at Nicki on track number two “Rattle.”

“I wanted everybody right here with me/ But that was my fault, bein’ too friendly/ I was thinkin’ everything was all good/ But the whole time, you was my enemy,” she raps in her opening verse.
She later appears to reference Nicki’s husband and child, spitting: “Damn, bitch, it been four years/ Worry ’bout your man and your kid/ Your life must be borin’ as fuck if you still reminiscin’ ’bout shit that we did.”

“It been four years” seems to be a nod to either Megan’s “WAP” collaboration with fellow Nicki Minaj rival Cardi B or Tory Lanez shooting her, which Nicki has made light of in her attacks against the “Savage” hitmaker.
Megan then appears to target Nicki’s allies by saying: “And I ain’t worried ’bout the bitter-bitch link-up/ Y’all hoes earned them seats in the fan club,” seemingly referencing the Young Money rapper bringing out JT, BIA, Akbar V and others during her Pink Friday 2 Tour.

Megan, Tina Snow’s first release since departing her former label 1501 Certified Ent. after a bitter legal battle, comes just a few months after a beef erupted between her and Nicki Minaj.
The feud was sparked by Megan’s venomous song “Hiss” on which she made a thinly-veiled reference to Nicki’s husband Kenneth Petty’s 1995 conviction for attempted rape.

“These hoes don’t be mad at Megan, these hoes mad at Megan’s Law,” she rapped, citing the federal law requiring authorities to make information available to the public regarding registered sex offenders.
