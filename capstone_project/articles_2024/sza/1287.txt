The "free concert" videos from the viral Milwaukee rapper featured a special guest on Saturday.
If you’re Ludacris, you’ve made a career out of “Disturbing tha Peace.”

That’s literally what happened on Saturday, when a severe thunderstorm forced the cancellation of his set at Tacos and Tequila Festival at Franklin Field. Fortunately, Luda linked up with viral Milwaukee rapper SteveDaStoner, and the two had a backup plan in place:

For context, this is nothing new for SteveDaStoner, who has gone viral multiple times in the past few months for throwing his “free concerts” around Milwaukee, by simply barging into establishments with a JBL PartyBox speaker and a microphone, performing the first verse of his song, “RWS” for whoever is around. The corner store, the bank, Wendy’s, college campuses, doesn’t matter. SteveDaStoner will pull up, and when he does, he’s bringing the free concert to you.

Footage of the free concert with Ludacris is making the rounds online, as Luda also stayed for a quick performance of his 2001 hit, “Move.” If you were seated at Kompali Tacos y Tortas inside the food hall, he brought the full Tacos and Tequila Fest to you:

Saturday’s storm brought high winds to Southeastern Wisconsin, forcing several outdoor events to close down early for the night, including a temporary stage shutdown at Summerfest and a postponement of Dave Matthews’ Band’s show at Alpine Valley. Country star Kenny Chesney performed at American Family Field without issue, and SZA’s headlining set at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater continued after a delay for storms and a Kim Kardashian sighting. Sunday’s “Not A Phase” festival at Franklin Field went on as planned without issue.

If you’re looking for more (planned) live music, check out our preview of this weekend at Summerfest, and check out who’s hitting Brew City stages this month. Or just wait for SteveDaStoner to show up for a free concert when you least expect it.
