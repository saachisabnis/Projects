Home    Forums    Music    Grammys 2025 Predictions (Part 14)
Right now I have the main 6 (not Ariana, I‚Äôm boldly predicting snubs in the GF for her) in AOTY, thinking of going Post Malone maybe? Trying to think of an 8th spot though, Vampire Weekend still doesn‚Äôt feel right. Can someone sell me on Jacob Collier?
Look AOTY is going to Billie. She is winning that award no way they won‚Äôt give to her and prob next year Taylor will win again come on now she is white . Am more focused on the other awards.
 he seems more likely to duet with artists with the power to score a solo top three on 10 albums in a row, rather than artists with absolute zero in the streaming era.

‚Äî Spotify Daily Data (@spotify_data) October 20, 2024
Wizkid & Brent Faiyez‚Äôs ‚ÄúPiece of My Heart‚Äù became the first song to hit 1m single-day Spotify streams in Nigeria. Spotify only launched there 2yrs ago, so quite impressive.
Average age is 19y, with 40% of population < 15y, and leanings towards Afrobeats, Urban & Trap, so next albums from SZA, Doja, Travis, Drake, Gunna, Ice, Lil Baby will see more global numbers.
Rihanna was overwhelmingly popular, loved and overplayed in Naij ever damn year I went, she‚Äôd probably blast that number with a new album. Beyonc√©, Drake, Adele, Cardi, Nicki, Chris Brown, and Shakira could still be carried by the 90s kids. 
Time heals everything‚Ä¶don‚Äôt end it‚Ä¶wait it out.
Honey, Jacob Collier is NOT happening in Album of the Year.¬† He was a committee pick a few years ago.
 He has one nomination and award in this category so far. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs a force in Pop Duo lol. Die With A Smile is winning because it‚Äôs the biggest eligible song. 
 but he is a grammy force in general‚Ä¶he never lost a nom since 2014 or 2016
 bruno is never losing in pop duo
The narrative of Bruno will never lose here is crazy when Gaga‚Äôs the one that won it twice. The one time Gaga did lose was with a Jazz cover and it lost to a huge hit by two artists that both had amazing years, this year that‚Äôs not the case at all
‚ÄúEvery time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time‚Äù
‚Äì Gaga has won a whopping 7 across Pop.
‚Äì Bruno got 3 (1 for every Pop era).
‚Äì Both combined will clear Pop Duo. 
Best to focus on that and leave 2026 arguments for 2026.
Time heals everything‚Ä¶don‚Äôt end it‚Ä¶wait it out.
wow, Charli‚Äôs two albums being pushed as one was supposedly doing over 150k this week but ended up with 105k, not even getting a new peak.
So about 50% of her predicted actual sales were thrown out as fraudulent, much like Paris Hilton.
Yet another example of ‚Äòbrat girl summer‚Äô domination being mostly social media smoke and mirrors.
before you post stupid chart stats please ask yourself:
is this relevant?
is this significant?
why am i posting this? is it because i actually think other users need to know, or is it because i have a random vendetta against the artist?
thank youüòÅ
Next Monday, A Bar Song should be the first song to have 13 weeks atop both the radio and digital sales charts.
Uptown Funk was the only one with 12 weeks atop both.
I think it‚Äôll do better than some people are expecting. The biggest minus is that there‚Äôs ~zero interest in him outside of the one song.

Well, the competition is also two artists with a successful year (Post and Taylor) but we still know that DWAS is going to win.
It's me... Hi

 sorry i totally forgot gaga is also a grammy force ! Probably the best one when it comes to pop
Apparently‚Ä¶ Tyla‚Äôs album was submitted to R&B Album and moved to Pop ‚Ä¶. (Seen this on twitter) did an actual publication confirm this ? lol i don‚Äôt think they would‚Äôve actually sent that album there
 sorry i totally forgot gaga is also a grammy force ! Probably the best one when it comes to pop 
I think she‚Äôs only a Grammy force when it comes to genre awards. She still hasn‚Äôt won a General Field Grammy.
