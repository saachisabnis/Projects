When every year comes to a close, Spotify users see who wound up on their Spotify Wrapped. Since 2016, the campaign has been a fan-favorite. So, music fans are wondering when they can expect to see all of their data from the beginning of 2024 to now.
Hollywood Life is breaking down all the details on how to access your Spotify Wrapped 2024.
As of December 4, 2024, Spotify Wrapped 2024 has been unveiled — and everybody was already aware of who the top artists were.

As for the most-streamed songs of 2024, Sabrina Carpenter took the N0. 1 spot for “Espresso” in both the U.S. and around the world.

Normally, Spotify Wrapped is released sometime after Thanksgiving Day (late November or early December). This year, it was released on December 4.
It’s simple — in order to get Spotify Wrapped, you need a Spotify account. The company also informed customers that they should keep their app up to date to see all of its latest features, according to a November press release.
“If your phone isn’t set to automatically update the app and you haven’t manually updated it in a while, you may be missing out on some pretty great features,” Spotify said in a press release. “An up-to-date app means you’re getting a fully optimized Wrapped experience. When the time comes for the big reveal of your personalized 2024 listening trends, you want to be ready.”
Although everyone’s Spotify Wrapped is based on their individual activity, most users contributed to the platform’s top-streamed artists of the year. Unsurprisingly, Taylor was on the list in addition to Bad Bunny, Drake, Travis Scott, SZA, Lana Del Rey and several more.
