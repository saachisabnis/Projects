Glastonbury Festival's 2025 tickets were snatched up in under 40 minutes, Worthy Farm announced. They flew off the virtual shelves shortly after going on sale at 9am, with organisers confirming by 9.35am that the event was sold out.
Ticket prices have risen to £373.50 with an additional £5 booking fee, marking an increase from 2024's cost of £355 plus a £5 booking fee. The festival shared an update saying: "Tickets for Glastonbury 2025 have now sold out."
Continuing, they expressed gratitude and offered apologies: "Thanks to everyone who bought one and sorry to those who missed out, on a morning when demand was much higher than supply. There will be a resale of any cancelled or returned tickets in spring 2025."
See Tickets also reported on the sell-out, commenting: "Tickets for @Glastonbury Festival 2025 are now SOLD OUT. Confirmation emails are going out now."
Adding their thanks, they said: "Thank you to everyone who bought tickets this morning and sorry to those who missed out."
Last year, main tickets disappeared in under an hour post-9am release. Just earlier this week, the initial batch of 2025 tickets, including coach travel, were gone within 30 minutes.
Looking ahead, Emily Eavis, the festival organiser, has intimated that 2026 is set to be a fallow year, providing a breather for the land. 
Meanwhile, she's already courting acts for the 2025 headliners, following last year’s lead with two female top-billed performers, Dua Lipa and SZA.
The 2024 edition etched another landmark as Coldplay became the first act to take the stage as headliners for five editions.
