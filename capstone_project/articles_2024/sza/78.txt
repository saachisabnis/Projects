Even though he has been performing and releasing music for over a decade, Kendrick Lamar has really been on a roll recently.
In September, it was announced that he was going to be the headliner for the upcoming Super Bowl halftime show.
On top of that, one of his latest songs, 'They Not Like Us', has been a hit on rhythmic and top 40 radio stations.  The track, which disses fellow hip hop artist Drake, is definitely one of the biggest earworms of 2024.
Given his recent wins, it only makes sense that he would hit the road in a big way in 2025.
It has been announced that Kendrick Lamar, along with SZA, will be hitting the road for the North American Grand National Tour.  The stadium tour will consist of 19 stops in the spring of 2025.  The tour will get underway on April 19th in Minneapolis and will conclude in Washington D. C. on June 18th.
The stop we are most excited for is the show at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on May 12th.
Interested in going to the show?  A press release from Patriots Media Relations says, in part:
Exclusive Cash App Visa Card pre-sale Wednesday, December 4th at 10am local time. General on sale starts Friday, December 6th at 10am local time
You can get all the details from the Grand National Tour website.
Even though the concert is about six months away, we know it is going to be worth the wait.  In the meantime, you can get a taste of what the show will be like by watching the Super Bowl halftime show on February 9th on Fox.
