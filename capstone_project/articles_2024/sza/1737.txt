The Darkness
* * * * *
AS the lights went up on The Darkness’s sweaty crowd at the end of a killer set, fans pleading for souvenir setlists, there was only one question – can any other band top that gig?
Ever?
Powering out a full-on set, packed with the entire debut album Permission To Land in its 10th anniversary year – plus a sprinkling of songs from their second album, comeback album and taster from the next one, there was barely a wasted second.
The love-in started from the moment intro track Second Fiddle began in blackness, the song introducing the band before gold lights revealed the four silhouetted band members holding hands centre stage, like four cartoon heroes.
The first surprise for those remembering the golden era when The Darkness were like the biggest and best rock joke in the world – but with incredibly infectious songs and Justin’s ludicrously-perfect rock vocals – was that these days brother Dan looks more like Justin than Justin does.
Hair dyed black, shorter, a demonic moustachio and a restrained black lycra jumpsuit – apart from the keyhole bare-skin section showing taut, muscled, tattooed stomach – Justin’s changed.
Only, not so much.
There’s still only one rock god on that stage.
And a more divaesque, fascinating, charismatic, irritating, gross-out, vocally-blessed frontman you are unlikely to meet.
