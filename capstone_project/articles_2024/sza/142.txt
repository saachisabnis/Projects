“Some of the biggest names in music will travel to Raleigh in only a few short weeks, bringing about one of the most highly anticipated festivals of the year. Our team looks forward to welcoming all of our day one fans from around the world back to Dreamville Festival,” Dreamville co-founder Adam Roy shared in a press statement.
In the comment section of the label’s flyer post, fans shared their excitement. One user wrote, “Ready to meet new people and vibe out to good music. See y’all in a couple [of] weeks, family!” Another stated, “Nah, y’all went crazy with this one.”
2023’s headliners included Usher, Drake, and Burna Boy. Lil Wayne also made a surprise appearance, in addition to well-received acts like Lil Durk, Summer Walker, and Ari Lennox.
Earlier this year, J. Cole embarked on the “It’s All a Blur Tour — Big As The What?” with the Toronto native. The pair made stops in Nashville, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Kansas City, and New Orleans already. Wayne will be filling in for the “GOMD” rapper later this month at shows in Pennsylvania and Newark, New Jersey.
