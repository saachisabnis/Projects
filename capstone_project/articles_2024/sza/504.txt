Monáe’s openness about embracing their body has been a defining theme in recent years. In a Rolling Stone interview tied to the release of their fourth studio album, The Age of Pleasure, Monáe shared, “I’m much happier when my titties are out and I can run around free.” Reflecting on their earlier penchant for tailored suits, Monáe explained, “Even when I was really, really wearing only suits, I was either in a suit or you would find me at my own parties naked. It was no in-between.”
Released in June 2023, The Age of Pleasure has been a significant milestone for Monáe, earning Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Progressive R&B Album. Their 39th birthday celebration only further showcases Monáe’s unwavering commitment to authenticity and self-expression.
