SZA struggles to keep men interested. The R&amp;B star recently opened up about her dating difficulties. “I feel like I can catch ’em, but I cannot keep ’em. They get with me and they realize I’m freaking weird, and then it’s just like, ‘Aight,'” says SZA. She humorously added, “The butt makes it seem like it’s normal. On the outside, I wanna shake ass and do all the normal things. But I also wanna swim in the swamp and collect methane gas with my man. That’s my type of sh-t.” What dating issues have you had?
