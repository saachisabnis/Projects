Following a massive 2024 which saw the summer’s biggest hit (“Not Like Us”), a spot in the Super Bowl Halftime Show, and a surprise album (GNX) that debuts at #1 on the Billboard 200 this week, Kendrick Lamar is kicking off 2025 by hitting the road in a major stadium tour with former TDE labelmate and frequent collaborator SZA.
The tour announcement comes as K. Dot becomes only the fourth artist in Billboard history to cover the top five on the Hot 100 this week. “Squabble Up” debuted at #1 this week, followed by “TV Off” (ft. Lefty Gunplay), “Luther” (ft. SZA), “Wacced Out Murals,” and “Hey Now” (ft. Dody6). He joins only Taylor Swift, The Beatles, and his rap nemesis Drake in having placed in the entire top 5 in a single week.
In addition, two more singles landed in the top 10 (“Reincarnated” at #8 and “Man at the Garden” at #9). That gives Kendrick a career total of 22 top 10 hits.
Tickets go on sale Friday, December 6, with a CashApp Visa Card  pre-sale set for tomorrow, December 3, at 10am. For more details, visit www.grandnationaltour.com.
