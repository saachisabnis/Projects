An unreleased Mac Miller is expected to arrive soon after a teaser trailer appeared during Tyler, the Creator‘s Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Los Angeles over the weekend. 
In a teaser trailer that appeared to advertise the lost project titled Balloonerism, a two-and-a-half minute video was viewed between Sampha and Alchemist & Friends’ sets. In a series of animations and what looked to be the album cover, the message “soon” was revealed alongside an image of Miller painted by artist Alim Smith — an image he posted on Instagram back in September 2018. Balloonerism is a long time coming for fans. Miller was said to have recorded the project before his 2014 mixtape Faces over the course of a week. However, there are rumors that the any involvement of Thundercat have been involved. Several songs on the album were released in 2020 and saw tracks featuring SZA and Dylan Reynolds. 
This album would mark the second posthumous album from the late Mac Miller. Watch the trailer captured by a fan below. No official release date has been revealed just yet.
