As Lollapalooza blew out the candles on its 20th birthday this year, the iconic Chicago music festival also unveiled an updated look that screams “next-gen cool.” The legendary fest started in 1991 as a scrappy counterculture roadshow and is now one of the world’s most sought-after multi-day music events. They joined forces with long-time design partner Someoddpilot to refresh and expand its identity for the new wave of festivalgoers (hello, Gen Z).
The brand update was a full-throttle extravaganza in true Lolla fashion, with the rollout beginning at Lollapalooza Chicago in 2023. If you were at Grant Park for this year’s mega show featuring Megan Thee Stallion, SZA, Hozier, and Chappell Roan, it was hard to miss the brand’s expanded digital and IRL footprint—vibrant pinks, electric blues, and dynamic graphics dancing on every surface. With over 10,000 branded touchpoints at the festival, Someoddpilot ensured Lolla’s identity was as omnipresent as the music blasting through the speakers.
Why the need for a brand refresh? Well, the festival’s audience has grown up and out—450,000 attendees last year alone—and with that, so have their expectations. Lollapalooza sought to meet this new crop of music lovers where they live: on TikTok, in the digital art world, and within the pulse of modern youth culture. So this year, C3 Presents and Live Nation, the festival’s parent brands, handed Someoddpilot the keys to drive Lolla’s brand into the future.
Someoddpilot certainly brought the goods. Born 25 years ago as an indie record label and known for another Windy City legend — the Pitchfork Music Festival — the Chicago-based agency was the perfect fit to bring Lolla’s brand identity into the now while staying true to its alt-culture origins. They dug deep into the 90s, when zines ruled, and the Xerox machine was the designer’s best friend and brought that gritty, DIY aesthetic into the 21st century.
Think cut-and-paste compositions, bold streaks from inkjet printers, grainy photos, and op-art graphics—all with a slick, vibrant twist. It’s a nod to the punk, metal, and electronic scenes that birthed Lollapalooza in the first place, but with a modern punch that resonates with today’s digital natives. It’s tangible nostalgia with a digital filter in the best possible way.
And it’s not just Chicago that’s getting the fresh look. Lollapalooza’s visual identity is going global, popping up at the festival’s offshoots in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and even Mumbai. This year’s 20th birthday celebration also birthed a new festival logo—a cheeky nod to the past where “20” sits snugly in place of the original logo’s double O’s.
Someoddpilot and Lollapalooza smartly made the updated identity flexible—after all, a music festival is chaotic, colorful, and (let’s be honest) unpredictable. The new identity shines across social media, digital ads, out-of-home displays, and within the festival grounds.
As Lollapalooza strides into its third decade, it’s not just keeping pace with the times—it’s defining them. With Someoddpilot at the helm, the fest embraces its past and charges into the future, one Xeroxed graphic at a time. Here’s to 20 more years of music, madness, and killer design. Cheers, Lolla!
