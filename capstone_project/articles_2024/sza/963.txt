The use of nitrous oxide seems to have become more prevalent in Hip Hop circles of late, as evidenced in part by last month’s revelation that Kanye West is battling a potentially fatal addiction to nitrous oxide.
According to his former chief of staff and far-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos, the substance is being supplied by Ye’s dentist. In an affidavit filed by Yiannopoulos against Thomas Connelly to the California Dental Board, he claimed that the dentist is charging Kanye more than $50,000 per month for the gas.

In the filing, Yiannopoulos makes a number of wild allegations against Connelly, including that he desired to run West’s Yeezy company and develop a “personal use N²O² system” for an annual salary of $2.4 million.
Yiannopoulos also claims that Connelly got the rap mogul hooked on nitrous gas and would deliver canisters of it to his home, while Kanye has been frequently seen inhaling it through an oxygen mask.

The affidavit also references a video posted online of Ye appearing to self-administer the gas while addressing boxer Ryan Garcia, saying: “Ryan Garcia, this Ye. I’m on the nitrous.”
Yiannopoulos claims that as a result of his gas addiction, Kanye has developed “distressing” side-effects and his behavior has concerned several Yeezy employees.
