After more than 1,500 votes cast over three rounds of voting, Billboard Pro members selected Universal Music Publishing Group chairman/CEO Jody Gerson for the 2024 Power Players’ Choice Award, which honors the executive they believe had the most impact across the business in the past year.

	Since Gerson joined UMPG in 2015, the company’s annual revenue has more than doubled to $2 billion and helped build the careers of superstars SZA, Post Malone, Harry Styles, Rosalía and others. With global markets showing increased revenue potential, Gerson says she’s focused on developing international opportunities to grow UMPG into the “undisputed market-share leader.” Last year, that resulted in high-profile deals with Carin León, Iván Cornejo and Grupo Firme in the booming regional Mexican genre.

	“I am grateful to be recognized by my peers in the music industry with the Billboard Power Players’ Choice Award,” says Gerson, who is also a board member at the National Music Publishers’ Association and co-founder of She Is the Music. “It is truly meaningful that they chose me. I am honored.”
