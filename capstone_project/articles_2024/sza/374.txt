	Glory be to the father (Charli XCX), the son (Sabrina Carpenter) and the holy spirit (Chappell Roan). Amen.

	Shortly after the Primavera Sound lineup was announced Thursday (Oct. 24), featuring all three women with top billing, the “365” singer took to X to declare that she and her co-headliners have now officially formed a sacred union. 

	“headlining primavera sound next year with sabrina and chappell,” Charli tweeted. “finally holy trinity unlocked ;)”

	Taking place at Barcelona’s Parc Del Fòrum June 5-7, the festival’s lineup will also feature sets from LCD Soundsystem, FKA Twigs, Fontaines DC, Clairo, Haim, Turnstile, Wet Leg, Beach House, Waxahatchee, Beabadoobee, Caribou, Anohni, Denzel Curry and more. The Brat summer ring leader previously performed at 2024’s iteration of Primavera Sound, which was headlined by Lana Del Rey, SZA and more.

	Regarding Charli’s tweet, it’s easy to see the connection between her, the “Espresso” singer and “Good Luck, Babe!” musician. All three pop stars had explosive breakthrough years in 2024, with the “Von Dutch” artist’s LP Brat reaching No. 3, Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet hitting No. 1 and Roan’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess ascending to No. 2 on the Billboard 200. All three of those chart peaks mark career highs for the artists.

	










	Charli is now in the midst of her Sweat Tour with Troye Sivan in support of Brat. In a recent interview with Apple Music 1’s Zane Lowe, the “Boom Clap” artist revealed that she originally didn’t think her latest album would “appeal to a lot of people,” something that partially inspired her now-iconic lime-green text-only cover art. 

	“Where the actual first idea of doing a text cover came from was to save money,” she said at the time. “It actually feels like it very much embodies the word ‘brat’ to kind of not be there, because that is sort of less of the norm, I suppose, for female artists. That felt punchy. The pixilation makes it looks like it’s kind of been done in this rush … you didn’t get the proper hi-res file… I knew it would generate this conversation. I knew that a lot of people would be sort of frustrated or disappointed by it.”
