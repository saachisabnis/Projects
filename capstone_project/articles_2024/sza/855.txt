Timbaland has been inducted into the 2024 Songwriters Hall of Fame.
Timbaland was among the musicians who were inducted at the 2024 Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction and Awards gala in New York on Tuesday night (June 11). Timbo's longtime collaborator Missy Elliott, who became the first female rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall in 2019, helped enshrine her creative partner into the SHOF.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, the veteran hitmaker thanked several artists in his speech, including Jay-Z, Justin Timberlake, the late R&B singer Aaliyah and rapper Magoo. He also credited Missy for his musical success. "I owe my career to Missy Elliott," Timbaland said.
The Virginia native concluded his speech thanking the Songwriters Hall for the induction. "Thanks for giving me a seat at the table—I've been waiting a long time," Timbo said.
Tim joins Jay-Z,  Missy, Jermaine Dupri, Snoop Dogg and The Neptunes as the hip-hop artists in the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
R&B singer SZA was also honored at the Songwriters Hall of Fame gala. The 34-year-old artist received the Hal David Starlight Award, an honor given to young songwriters. During the event, SZA performed an acoustic version of her 2022 song "Snooze" from her SOS project.
"I'm just beyond all of my wildest dreams," SZA said during her acceptance speech (via People). "I'm just so grateful. Thank you for seeing me. I swear, I'll be like, 'Oh I wrote this and I wrote that. And [people would] be like, 'OK,' especially if you're a woman, especially if you're a Black woman. So to win this... It just means the world."
