From music to movies to museums, it’s been a banner year for pop culture in Pittsburgh. Here are just a few of the stories that captured our attention in 2024.

Science Center gets 
a new name
In January, it was announced that the Carnegie Science Center would be renamed “The Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center.” Daniel G. Kamin is a real estate development entrepreneur, and he and his wife, Carole L. Kamin, made a historic $65 million contribution to the Science Center — the largest donation in Carnegie Museums’ history since the original endowment by Andrew Carnegie. The main signage from the Science Center was removed in December for the sake of building maintenance — but it won’t be replaced until the new name goes into use in 2025.

Women ruled at 
the Heinz History Center
In March, the Heinz History Center in the Strip District opened its “A Woman’s Place” exhibit. The first-floor installation explores the contributions of women in Western Pennsylvania and beyond, including influential figures in areas including government, arts and culture, activism and sports. Speaking of sports, the History Center acquired real-life artifacts from the womens’ baseball league that inspired the film “A League of Their Own” on loan from the Smithsonian. “A Woman’s Place” was set to close in October, but it proved so popular that its run has been extended into January.

The thrills were gone
In April, international music festival giant C3 Presents announced that they would bring Sudden Little Thrills — a new two-day music festival — to Hazelwood Green on Sept. 7 and 8. The announced lineup included popular acts The Killers, SZA and Pittsburgh’s own Wiz Khalifa. But then, in May, the organizers suddenly announced that Sudden Little Thrills would be canceled and all of the already-
purchased passes would be 
refunded, much to the disappointment of many Pittsburghers. A reason for the cancellation never was revealed.

Paris Olympics were lit
This summer, the Summer Olympics took over Paris, France — and the attention of spectators all over the world. After a controversial tableau at the Opening Ceremony including drag queens and LGBTQIA+ performers that many believed was meant to evoke da Vinci’s “The Last Supper,” the games began in earnest. Five athletes from Western Pennsylvania competed in the games, and Upper St. Clair’s Josh Matheny placed seventh in the 200-meter breaststroke finals. The next Summer Olympics will be held in 2028 in the United States, so prepare for even more Olympic fever next time!

Local native found new life 
in hit ‘Beetlejuice’ sequel
Coraopolis-born actor Michael Keaton reprised his iconic “Beetlejuice” role (from the 1988 original film) in a sequel that was released in September, appropriately titled “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” Starring alongside Winona Ryder, Jenna Ortega and Catherine O’Hara, Keaton looked like he had a lot of fun re-embodying the titular character. And it was a big success, too, raking in more than $450 million dollars at the box office. It also earned Keaton a slot hosting “Saturday Night Live” and an opening appearance on “Sunday Night Football” in October — a well-deserved renaissance for a hometown star.

The return of ‘Hamilton’ was a boon for the Cultural District
The smash-hit 2015 Broadway musical “Hamilton” made its return to Pittsburgh in September as part of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh series. The electrifying show’s three-week national tour stop had theater-loving fans flocking to Downtown Pittsburgh’s Benedum Center — and it had a big impact. According to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the show brought 64,000 visitors to the Cultural District and generated $25 million in economic activity.

Pittsburgh Zoo regained accreditation and plans a revitalization
The Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium lost several of its beloved animals this year, including a 31-year-old silverback gorilla, a 2-year-old elephant calf and an 18-year-old sea lion in February. While this isn’t abnormal, it was still tough for the zoo community. But in September, the zoo regained its accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which it had lost nearly a decade prior. This spurred the launch of an ambitious 20-year renovation project that will update and revitalize the zoo’s treasured Highland Park campus.

Jay Leno took a tumble
Longtime ‘Tonight Show’ host and comedian Jay Leno had a show at the Palace Theatre in Greensburg on Nov. 15. Just hours before he was set to take the stage, Leno fell down a hill while walking to The Boulevard restaurant in Hempfield. The star suffered multiple injuries, particularly to his face and eye. But that didn’t prevent the industry pro from getting to lunch — and from performing later that day, eyepatch and all.

The smash-hit 2015 Broadway musical “Hamilton” made its return to Pittsburgh in September as part of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh series. The electrifying show’s three-week national tour stop had theater-loving fans flocking to Downtown Pittsburgh’s Benedum Center — and it had a big impact. According to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the show brought 64,000 visitors to the Cultural District and generated $25 million in economic activity.

Pittsburgh Zoo regained accreditation and plans a revitalization
The Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium lost several of its beloved animals this year, including a 31-year-old silverback gorilla, a 2-year-old elephant calf and an 18-year-old sea lion in February. While this isn’t abnormal, it was still tough for the zoo community. But in September, the zoo regained its accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which it had lost nearly a decade prior. This spurred the launch of an ambitious 20-year renovation project that will update and revitalize the zoo’s treasured Highland Park campus.

Jay Leno took a tumble
Longtime ‘Tonight Show’ host and comedian Jay Leno had a show at the Palace Theatre in Greensburg on Nov. 15. Just hours before he was set to take the stage, Leno fell down a hill while walking to The Boulevard restaurant in Hempfield. The star suffered multiple injuries, particularly to his face and eye. But that didn’t prevent the industry pro from getting to lunch — and from performing later that day, eyepatch and all.





Local native found new life 
in hit ‘Beetlejuice’ sequel
Coraopolis-born actor Michael Keaton reprised his iconic “Beetlejuice” role (from the 1988 original film) in a sequel that was released in September, appropriately titled “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” Starring alongside Winona Ryder, Jenna Ortega and Catherine O’Hara, Keaton looked like he had a lot of fun re-embodying the titular character. And it was a big success, too, raking in more than $450 million dollars at the box office. It also earned Keaton a slot hosting “Saturday Night Live” and an opening appearance on “Sunday Night Football” in October — a well-deserved renaissance for a hometown star.
