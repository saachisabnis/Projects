While we already look forward to next year's edition, let's take one final look back at this year's sometimes sunny, sometimes soggy, always entertaining Big Gig.
The Great Milwaukee Summer is HERE! Your guide to what you'll be doing, where you'll be drinking, who you'll be hearing and how you'll be getting a sweet tan this summer is on OnMilwaukee. The Great Milwaukee Summer guide is brought to you by Geis Garage Doors and Peoples State Bank! 
The stages are all cleaned and cleared. The Saz's sampler platters are all eaten. The selfies with Dan Jacobs at the new DanDan food stand are all taken and posted. And the knee soreness from roaming around the grounds and standing on bleachers ... well, the knees are still not feeling 100 percent, but we're getting there. Give these joints another week. 

Yes, it's somehow already another wrap on another Big Gig, with a whole new batch of musical memories adding to our mental playlists. Now, we could start looking ahead until the summer spectacular returns ... but that's, like, 300-some days away and depressing. So instead of already looking forward to next year's far-off edition, let's look back at the past three weekends of lakefront-set lunacy.

As a staff, we saw and reviewed more than 30 acts across the entire festival, ranging from Amp mega-shows to small afternoon sets, retro favorites and the latest TikTok sensations, rap and EDM to country and rock. Sometimes it was sunny; more often it seemed soggy. But it was always greatly entertaining. So let's look back at the best, the worst, the "is Kim Kardashian here?!" and the everything in between of Summerfest 2024.

(And hey, next year's edition may seem far off – but on the glass-half-full side, today is as far away as it'll ever be. We'll see you there next summer!)

Day 1
Kane Brown

"Known for his genre-blending style and captivating performances, Brown headlined the festival's opening night, leaving the crowd buzzing with excitement and setting the tone for the impressive cast of performers who will follow in the coming weeks." (Read the rest here.)

Better Than Ezra

"I was both surprised and delighted by the band’s ability to – not only attract a crowd for such an early show – but keep the crowd thoroughly entertained for the duration of their performance with a mix of popular classics, creative medleys and songs from their new album 'Super Magick,' their first new release in a decade." (Read the rest here.)

Taking Back Sunday

X
"One of the best feelings at a concert, no matter the band or genre, is when the night feels like a communal experience. Thursday night, Taking Back Sunday brought that, showing their strengths as a band that has aged gracefully while many of their contemporaries from the explosion of pop punk and emo can’t exactly say the same. They were just as powerful as they’ve always been and continue to put in every ounce of effort when it comes to their performances. That’s becoming rare territory, but the band showed exactly why that makes all the difference." (Read the rest here.)

David Kushner

X
"This performance left me questioning if Kushner's rapid rise to fame through TikTok had propelled a mediocre talent into stardom, resulting in a lackluster show, minimal stage presence and a strained voice that couldn't endure a 48-minute performance. Time and experience will be crucial in determining the future of David Kushner as a singer." (Read the rest here.)

Day 2
Motley Crue 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Mötley Crüe's presence brought a blast of classic rock flair to the festival's first weekend headliner slate, with Friday's show featuring all the hits and loud charisma that have made the members household names." (Read the rest here.)

Taylor Bennett

"It’s fitting that Bennett’s most recent single is titled '2 Much,' because frankly, that was his approach to his performance. There was certainly effort on Bennett’s behalf, but things didn’t really seem to click for him at the Oasis. In the course of 45 minutes, he utilized just about every audience-invoking gimmick that he could to try and get the crowd going. A pair of backup dancers hit the stage behind him for select songs, and he’d take his shirt off midway through the set to try and elicit some cheers from the crowd. He’d ask for phones and lighters up in the sky, which also fell flat, because it was still light out. Through no real fault of his own, the show failed to resonate with a crowd that formed to see him." (Read the rest here.)







Day 3
SZA 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Considering that Summerfest has a vast history dating back more than half of a century, it’s hard to say when certain nights at the festival become truly infamous. That being said, it is also very safe to say that SZA’s Saturday night show to close out the opening weekend of this year’s festival will certainly go down as one of the most memorable nights of recent Summerfest history, if not of all time. It was a night full of weather delays, celebrity sightings and also a crowning moment for one of the new queens of contemporary R&B." (Read the rest here.)

Goo Goo Dolls 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Never a die-hard fan, I went into my first Goo Goo concert in the wake of two weeks of listening to playlists filled with a selection of songs from their 14 studio albums to build familiarity with their canon. If I'm honest, I came out wondering what all the fuss was really about.

"But there was something about seeing The Goo Goo Dolls live that I can't really explain.

"What I can say is that, if music is indeed the language of emotion, there was plenty of neurochemical magic flowing throughout the 90-minute show, which offered the audience a taste of the Goo Goo canon from 1995 through 2023." (Read the rest here.)

Dawes 

PHOTO: Ty Helbach
X
"With moving songs like 'A Little Bit of Everything' and 'All Your Favorite Bands,' Americana rock band Dawes knows their way around telling a good story – and they and their fans at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard on Saturday certainly have a new one to tell thanks to their night at Summerfest, thanks to dramatic storms and forecasts threatening to shut things down early before the band even got to take the stage." (Read the rest here.)

Day 4
Illenium 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Kicking off Summerfest's second weekend, Illenium brought down the house at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater on Thursday night. As one of the festival's biggest headliners, Illenium brought his signature blend of melodic bass and electronic beats to the Big Gig’s biggest stage, captivating the dancing crowd with a powerful set." (Read the rest here.)

Tiffany 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"It must be incredibly challenging at times to be, at 52 years old, still compared to her famous 15-year-old self. But Tiffany seems to take it in stride. Plus, she is clearly confident in the power and precision of her voice and wants to have a good time on stage while interacting with her fans." (Read the rest here.)

MUNA 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"This, however, was a much stronger MUNA than the guitar-oriented pop band that was cutting their teeth in 2017. The band is now three albums deep, playing major festivals worldwide and serving as the openers for Taylor Swift on several stops on the 'Eras' tour. They used that stadium-level experience on Thursday to deliver a tight set in every aspect, igniting shrieks from a full seating bowl at just about every turn." (Read the rest here.)

Alison Wonderland 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"If you felt the ground shake last night, don't worry; it wasn't an earthquake. It was Alison Wonderland warming up Summerfest for her electrifying DJ set. The booming bass, complemented by mesmerizing graphics, formed a celestial gateway that immersed the audience in Alison Wonderland's signature blend of bass, chillwave, trap and electronic-soaked airy darkness for her entire hour-long Summerfest set." (Read the rest here.)

Ian Asher 

PHOTO: Alyssa Rinelli
X
"It's no surprise that Asher has risen to fame with his unique mix of club beats and hit songs. His set, which often feature unexpected mashups like AC/DC with iconic club beats, kept the Summerfest crowd dancing for well over an hour. Asher's infectious energy and enthusiasm, evident as he dances and sings along with the crowd, made this performance feel like a shared celebration." (Read the rest here.)







Day 5
All-American Rejects 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"It was wet and gross down at the Summerfest grounds on Friday night, but even as everyone in attendance absorbed five fresh pounds of water weight into their clothes, nothing could dampen the nostalgic vibes over at the Uline Warehouse stage as 2000s pop-rockers All-American Rejects put on an energetic 90-minute show worthy of witnessing in a downpour and having to wring out your entire outfit afterward." (Read the rest here.)

ISOxo 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"EDM is fickle in the sense that it's very easy to have a good show, but it also doesn't take much for things to go into unsaveable territory quickly. For ISOxo on Friday night, he never let the rain or a diminished crowd get to him. Instead, he raged with the most loyal of EDM fans in the middle of a torrential storm. Most importantly, he did it as if there was no other way." (Read the rest here.)

Day 6
Keith Urban 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"When Urban did take a quick timeout to chat with the crowd, it was just as pleasant and compelling. The man has a calm, low-key charm and charisma on stage that feels authentic and unforced – whether he's interviewing a local couple about their upcoming wedding (more on that in a second ... ), leading a 'Freddie Mercury at Live Aid'-esque call-and-answer or chatting with his bandmates about their glorious first Summerfest ... playing at 11 a.m. Even if you hate country music, Urban puts on a personable and impressive show that's easy to love." (Read the rest here.) 

The Hold Steady 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Craig Finn, frontman for The Hold Steady, once said "irony is certainly not something I want to be accused of,” and after witnessing him perform on the Miller Lite Oasis Saturday night, that accusation is never gonna happen. Finn – with his four bandmates (two of whom were celebrating a birthday) – ripped through 15 songs during the hour set with energetic earnesty. His endearing nerdy movements were in full force, with an abundance of exaggerated pointing and wide spread arms." (Read the rest here.)

The Dandy Warhols 

PHOTO: Mike Morgan
X
"To my recollection, they hadn’t played Summerfest before, and both McCabe and lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor agreed. So I left their dressing room and took my spot in the pit and waited to once again to find my live music happy place. It only took one song." (Read the rest here.)

Key Glock

"When he was onstage and focused, Key Glock showed all of the potential of a stadium-filling rapper with loyal fans. There certainly seems to be a lot invested in his live show. However, when that focus was gone, as it seemed to be on the back half of Saturday's set, it felt like a wasted opportunity. Hopefully it was just an off night." (Read the rest here.)

Day 7
AJR 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Yesterday may have marked a national holiday, but AJR wasn’t in the mood to relax or take any time off Thursday night, instead working overtime to entertain the mostly full Fourth of July crowd gathered at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater. Yes, the July 3rd fireworks may have been a no-show this year, but the trio of hit-making brothers and their brassy band kindly brought their own kind of grandiose and colorful display to the lakefront in its place – fittingly complete with plenty of oohs and ahhs as well as maybe a few fizzles and misfires too." (Read the rest here.)

Sueco

X
"As a patch of rain trickled down on the Summerfest grounds, fans trickled into the Generac Power Stage area to see pop punk/hip hop hybrid Sueco on Thursday at Summerfest. Before the end of his set, that crowd would build to a small flood, and for good reason." (Read the rest here.)

Day 8
Bryson Tiller

X
"Milwaukeeans must be used to all this rain by now because even some ominous skies didn’t stop Brew City for turning out big for hip-hop/R&B singer Bryson Tiller at the Big Gig Friday night." (Read the rest here.)

Local Natives 

PHOTO: Ty Helbach
X
"I hate encores. At least I hate the broken modern version of them, where everyone has to pretend the band's not going to play the rest of their set – including sometimes their biggest songs – without the audience paying some silly applause tax to bring them back out. It's all so cumbersome and contrived.







"But when you get a real encore? A genuine moment where the mutual musical love between the crowd and the band inspires a truly unexpected bonus final bow? That's the stuff musical memories are made of – and that's what happened Friday night at Local Natives." (Read the rest here.)

DC The Don

X
"Milwaukee-born rapper DC The Don’s set on Friday at the USCelluar Connection Stage at Summerfest was nothing short of chaotic, disorganized, and reckless. And you know what? It was damn fun, too." (Read the rest here.)

Day 9
Lil Uzi Vert

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing." (Read the rest here.)

Living Colour

X
"Though they’ve performed here pretty regularly in recent years, with a Summerfest show in 2021 and a State Fair gig in 2018, plus indoor gigs in 2023 and 2016, I haven’t seen Living Colour since its Milwaukee debut at the UW-Milwaukee Union Ballroom in 1988. Frankly, though their hair – and mine – is much greyer, they haven’t lost a step." (Read the rest here.)

Neon Trees 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"In between rocking out to their hits, Glenn took a few moments to share personal anecdotes on his journey to stardom with the crowd. He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

Cold War Kids

X
"The lead singer, Nathan Willett, seemed possessed by the music, allowing the sounds to flow over, around and through him until it became one with him. The concert was more than just a performance; it was an experience where the music and the performers melded into something greater than the songs they played." (Read the rest here.)

Quad City DJs
"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel." (Read the rest here.)

Digital Underground

X
"Shock G, the memorable face and voice of the group, unfortunately passed in 2021, so “Young Hump” – aka Chris Clarke – now dons the iconic nose and glasses on stage alongside fellow original member Money-B. And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article. It's just a tall task to try and authentically recapture such a one-of-a-kind, uniquely oddball persona." (Read the rest here.)

C+C Music Factory 

PHOTO: Ty Helbach
X
"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

Yes, it's somehow already another wrap on another Big Gig, with a whole new batch of musical memories adding to our mental playlists. Now, we could start looking ahead until the summer spectacular returns ... but that's, like, 300-some days away and depressing. So instead of already looking forward to next year's far-off edition, let's look back at the past three weekends of lakefront-set lunacy.

As a staff, we saw and reviewed more than 30 acts across the entire festival, ranging from Amp mega-shows to small afternoon sets, retro favorites and the latest TikTok sensations, rap and EDM to country and rock. Sometimes it was sunny; more often it seemed soggy. But it was always greatly entertaining. So let's look back at the best, the worst, the "is Kim Kardashian here?!" and the everything in between of Summerfest 2024.

He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

"Shock G, the memorable face and voice of the group, unfortunately passed in 2021, so “Young Hump” – aka Chris Clarke – now dons the iconic nose and glasses on stage alongside fellow original member Money-B. And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article.

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

As a staff, we saw and reviewed more than 30 acts across the entire festival, ranging from Amp mega-shows to small afternoon sets, retro favorites and the latest TikTok sensations, rap and EDM to country and rock. Sometimes it was sunny; more often it seemed soggy. But it was always greatly entertaining. So let's look back at the best, the worst, the "is Kim Kardashian here?!" and the everything in between of Summerfest 2024.

(And hey, next year's edition may seem far off – but on the glass-half-full side, today is as far away as it'll ever be. We'll see you there next summer!)

Day 1
Kane Brown

"Known for his genre-blending style and captivating performances, Brown headlined the festival's opening night, leaving the crowd buzzing with excitement and setting the tone for the impressive cast of performers who will follow in the coming weeks." (Read the rest here.)

Better Than Ezra

"I was both surprised and delighted by the band’s ability to – not only attract a crowd for such an early show – but keep the crowd thoroughly entertained for the duration of their performance with a mix of popular classics, creative medleys and songs from their new album 'Super Magick,' their first new release in a decade." (Read the rest here.)

Taking Back Sunday 

PHOTO: Ty Helbach
X
"One of the best feelings at a concert, no matter the band or genre, is when the night feels like a communal experience. Thursday night, Taking Back Sunday brought that, showing their strengths as a band that has aged gracefully while many of their contemporaries from the explosion of pop punk and emo can’t exactly say the same. They were just as powerful as they’ve always been and continue to put in every ounce of effort when it comes to their performances. That’s becoming rare territory, but the band showed exactly why that makes all the difference." (Read the rest here.)

David Kushner

X
"This performance left me questioning if Kushner's rapid rise to fame through TikTok had propelled a mediocre talent into stardom, resulting in a lackluster show, minimal stage presence and a strained voice that couldn't endure a 48-minute performance. Time and experience will be crucial in determining the future of David Kushner as a singer." (Read the rest here.)

Day 2
Motley Crue

"Mötley Crüe's presence brought a blast of classic rock flair to the festival's first weekend headliner slate, with Friday's show featuring all the hits and loud charisma that have made the members household names." (Read the rest here.)

Taylor Bennett

"It’s fitting that Bennett’s most recent single is titled '2 Much,' because frankly, that was his approach to his performance. There was certainly effort on Bennett’s behalf, but things didn’t really seem to click for him at the Oasis. In the course of 45 minutes, he utilized just about every audience-invoking gimmick that he could to try and get the crowd going. A pair of backup dancers hit the stage behind him for select songs, and he’d take his shirt off midway through the set to try and elicit some cheers from the crowd. He’d ask for phones and lighters up in the sky, which also fell flat, because it was still light out. Through no real fault of his own, the show failed to resonate with a crowd that formed to see him." (Read the rest here.)







Day 3
SZA

"Considering that Summerfest has a vast history dating back more than half of a century, it’s hard to say when certain nights at the festival become truly infamous. That being said, it is also very safe to say that SZA’s Saturday night show to close out the opening weekend of this year’s festival will certainly go down as one of the most memorable nights of recent Summerfest history, if not of all time. It was a night full of weather delays, celebrity sightings and also a crowning moment for one of the new queens of contemporary R&B." (Read the rest here.)

Goo Goo Dolls 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Never a die-hard fan, I went into my first Goo Goo concert in the wake of two weeks of listening to playlists filled with a selection of songs from their 14 studio albums to build familiarity with their canon. If I'm honest, I came out wondering what all the fuss was really about.

"But there was something about seeing The Goo Goo Dolls live that I can't really explain.

"What I can say is that, if music is indeed the language of emotion, there was plenty of neurochemical magic flowing throughout the 90-minute show, which offered the audience a taste of the Goo Goo canon from 1995 through 2023." (Read the rest here.)

Dawes

"With moving songs like 'A Little Bit of Everything' and 'All Your Favorite Bands,' Americana rock band Dawes knows their way around telling a good story – and they and their fans at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard on Saturday certainly have a new one to tell thanks to their night at Summerfest, thanks to dramatic storms and forecasts threatening to shut things down early before the band even got to take the stage."

Day 4
Illenium

"Kicking off Summerfest's second weekend, Illenium brought down the house at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater on Thursday night. As one of the festival's biggest headliners, Illenium brought his signature blend of melodic bass and electronic beats to the Big Gig’s biggest stage, captivating the dancing crowd with a powerful set."

Tiffany

"It must be incredibly challenging at times to be, at 52 years old, still compared to her famous 15-year-old self. But Tiffany seems to take it in stride. Plus, she is clearly confident in the power and precision of her voice and wants to have a good time on stage while interacting with her fans." (Read the rest here.)

MUNA 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"This, however, was a much stronger MUNA than the guitar-oriented pop band that was cutting their teeth in 2017. The band is now three albums deep, playing major festivals worldwide and serving as the openers for Taylor Swift on several stops on the 'Eras' tour. They used that stadium-level experience on Thursday to deliver a tight set in every aspect, igniting shrieks from a full seating bowl at just about every turn." (Read the rest here.)

Alison Wonderland

X
"If you felt the ground shake last night, don't worry; it wasn't an earthquake. It was Alison Wonderland warming up Summerfest for her electrifying DJ set. The booming bass, complemented by mesmerizing graphics, formed a celestial gateway that immersed the audience in Alison Wonderland's signature blend of bass, chillwave, trap and electronic-soaked airy darkness for her entire hour-long Summerfest set."

Ian Asher

"It's no surprise that Asher has risen to fame with his unique mix of club beats and hit songs. His set, which often feature unexpected mashups like AC/DC with iconic club beats, kept the Summerfest crowd dancing for well over an hour. Asher's infectious energy and enthusiasm, evident as he dances and sings along with the crowd, made this performance feel like a shared celebration." (Read the rest here.)







Day 5
All-American Rejects

"It was wet and gross down at the Summerfest grounds on Friday night, but even as everyone in attendance absorbed five fresh pounds of water weight into their clothes, nothing could dampen the nostalgic vibes over at the Uline Warehouse stage as 2000s pop-rockers All-American Rejects put on an energetic 90-minute show worthy of witnessing in a downpour and having to wring out your entire outfit afterward." (Read the rest here.)

ISOxo

X
"EDM is fickle in the sense that it's very easy to have a good show, but it also doesn't take much for things to go into unsaveable territory quickly. For ISOxo on Friday night, he never let the rain or a diminished crowd get to him. Instead, he raged with the most loyal of EDM fans in the middle of a torrential storm. Most importantly, he did it as if there was no other way." (Read the rest here.)

Day 6
Keith Urban 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"When Urban did take a quick timeout to chat with the crowd, it was just as pleasant and compelling. The man has a calm, low-key charm and charisma on stage that feels authentic and unforced – whether he's interviewing a local couple about their upcoming wedding (more on that in a second ... ), leading a 'Freddie Mercury at Live Aid'-esque call-and-answer or chatting with his bandmates about their glorious first Summerfest ... playing at 11 a.m. Even if you hate country music, Urban puts on a personable and impressive show that's easy to love." (Read the rest here.) 

The Hold Steady

"Craig Finn, frontman for The Hold Steady, once said "irony is certainly not something I want to be accused of,” and after witnessing him perform on the Miller Lite Oasis Saturday night, that accusation is never gonna happen. Finn – with his four bandmates (two of whom were celebrating a birthday) – ripped through 15 songs during the hour set with energetic earnesty. His endearing nerdy movements were in full force, with an abundance of exaggerated pointing and wide spread arms." (Read the rest here.)

The Dandy Warhols

"To my recollection, they hadn’t played Summerfest before, and both McCabe and lead singer Courtney Taylor-Taylor agreed. So I left their dressing room and took my spot in the pit and waited to once again to find my live music happy place. It only took one song." (Read the rest here.)

Key Glock

"When he was onstage and focused, Key Glock showed all of the potential of a stadium-filling rapper with loyal fans. There certainly seems to be a lot invested in his live show. However, when that focus was gone, as it seemed to be on the back half of Saturday's set, it felt like a wasted opportunity. Hopefully it was just an off night." (Read the rest here.)

Day 7
AJR 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"Yesterday may have marked a national holiday, but AJR wasn’t in the mood to relax or take any time off Thursday night, instead working overtime to entertain the mostly full Fourth of July crowd gathered at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater. Yes, the July 3rd fireworks may have been a no-show this year, but the trio of hit-making brothers and their brassy band kindly brought their own kind of grandiose and colorful display to the lakefront in its place – fittingly complete with plenty of oohs and ahhs as well as maybe a few fizzles and misfires too." (Read the rest here.)

Sueco 

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"As a patch of rain trickled down on the Summerfest grounds, fans trickled into the Generac Power Stage area to see pop punk/hip hop hybrid Sueco on Thursday at Summerfest. Before the end of his set, that crowd would build to a small flood, and for good reason." (Read the rest here.)

Day 8
Bryson Tiller

"Milwaukeeans must be used to all this rain by now because even some ominous skies didn’t stop Brew City for turning out big for hip-hop/R&B singer Bryson Tiller at the Big Gig Friday night." (Read the rest here.)

Local Natives

X
"I hate encores. At least I hate the broken modern version of them, where everyone has to pretend the band's not going to play the rest of their set – including sometimes their biggest songs – without the audience paying some silly applause tax to bring them back out. It's all so cumbersome and contrived.







"But when you get a real encore? A genuine moment where the mutual musical love between the crowd and the band inspires a truly unexpected bonus final bow? That's the stuff musical memories are made of – and that's what happened Friday night at Local Natives." (Read the rest here.)

DC The Don

"Milwaukee-born rapper DC The Don’s set on Friday at the USCelluar Connection Stage at Summerfest was nothing short of chaotic, disorganized, and reckless. And you know what? It was damn fun, too." (Read the rest here.)

Day 9
Lil Uzi Vert

PHOTO: Dan Garcia
X
"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

Living Colour

"Though they’ve performed here pretty regularly in recent years, with a Summerfest show in 2021 and a State Fair gig in 2018, plus indoor gigs in 2023 and 2016, I haven’t seen Living Colour since its Milwaukee debut at the UW-Milwaukee Union Ballroom in 1988. Frankly, though their hair – and mine – is much greyer, they haven’t lost a step."

After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

"Though they’ve performed here pretty regularly in recent years, with a Summerfest show in 2021 and a State Fair gig in 2018, plus indoor gigs in 2023 and 2016, I haven’t seen Living Colour since its Milwaukee debut at the UW-Milwaukee Union Ballroom in 1988. Frankly, though their hair – and mine – is much greyer, they haven’t lost a step."

"In between rocking out to their hits, Glenn took a few moments to share personal anecdotes on his journey to stardom with the crowd. He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

"The lead singer, Nathan Willett, seemed possessed by the music, allowing the sounds to flow over, around and through him until it became one with him. The concert was more than just a performance; it was an experience where the music and the performers melded into something greater than the songs they played." (Read the rest here.)

Quad City DJs
"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

"Shock G, the memorable face and voice of the group, unfortunately passed in 2021, so “Young Hump” – aka Chris Clarke – now dons the iconic nose and glasses on stage alongside fellow original member Money-B. And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article. It's just a tall task to try and authentically recapture such a one-of-a-kind, uniquely oddball persona." (Read the rest here.)

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

"One of the best feelings at a concert, no matter the band or genre, is when the night feels like a communal experience. Thursday night, Taking Back Sunday brought that, showing their strengths as a band that has aged gracefully while many of their contemporaries from the explosion of pop punk and emo can’t exactly say the same. They were just as powerful as they’ve always been and continue to put in every ounce of effort when it comes to their performances. That’s becoming rare territory, but the band showed exactly why that makes all the difference." (Read the rest here.)

"It’s fitting that Bennett’s most recent single is titled '2 Much,' because frankly, that was his approach to his performance. There was certainly effort on Bennett’s behalf, but things didn’t really seem to click for him at the Oasis. In the course of 45 minutes, he utilized just about every audience-invoking gimmick that he could to try and get the crowd going. A pair of backup dancers hit the stage behind him for select songs, and he’d take his shirt off midway through the set to try and elicit some cheers from the crowd. He’d ask for phones and lighters up in the sky, which also fell flat, because it was still light out. Through no real fault of his own, the show failed to resonate with a crowd that formed to see him." (Read the rest here.)

"Considering that Summerfest has a vast history dating back more than half of a century, it’s hard to say when certain nights at the festival become truly infamous. That being said, it is also very safe to say that SZA’s Saturday night show to close out the opening weekend of this year’s festival will certainly go down as one of the most memorable nights of recent Summerfest history, if not of all time. It was a night full of weather delays, celebrity sightings and also a crowning moment for one of the new queens of contemporary R&B." (Read the rest here.)

"But there was something about seeing The Goo Goo Dolls live that I can't really explain.

"What I can say is that, if music is indeed the language of emotion, there was plenty of neurochemical magic flowing throughout the 90-minute show, which offered the audience a taste of the Goo Goo canon from 1995 through 2023." (Read the rest here.)

"Though they’ve performed here pretty regularly in recent years, with a Summerfest show in 2021 and a State Fair gig in 2018, plus indoor gigs in 2023 and 2016, I haven’t seen Living Colour since its Milwaukee debut at the UW-Milwaukee Union Ballroom in 1988. Frankly, though their hair – and mine – is much greyer, they haven’t lost a step."

Neon Trees

"In between rocking out to their hits, Glenn took a few moments to share personal anecdotes on his journey to stardom with the crowd. He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

Cold War Kids

"The lead singer, Nathan Willett, seemed possessed by the music, allowing the sounds to flow over, around and through him until it became one with him. The concert was more than just a performance; it was an experience where the music and the performers melded into something greater than the songs they played." (Read the rest here.)

Quad City DJs
"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

Digital Underground

"Shock G, the memorable face and voice of the group, unfortunately passed in 2021, so “Young Hump” – aka Chris Clarke – now dons the iconic nose and glasses on stage alongside fellow original member Money-B. And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article. It's just a tall task to try and authentically recapture such a one-of-a-kind, uniquely oddball persona." (Read the rest here.)

C+C Music Factory

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later." (Read the rest here.)

      
"One of the best feelings at a concert, no matter the band or genre, is when the night feels like a communal experience. Thursday night, Taking Back Sunday brought that, showing their strengths as a band that has aged gracefully while many of their contemporaries from the explosion of pop punk and emo can’t exactly say the same. They were just as powerful as they’ve always been and continue to put in every ounce of effort when it comes to their performances. That’s becoming rare territory, but the band showed exactly why that makes all the difference." (Read the rest here.)

"This performance left me questioning if Kushner's rapid rise to fame through TikTok had propelled a mediocre talent into stardom, resulting in a lackluster show, minimal stage presence and a strained voice that couldn't endure a 48-minute performance. Time and experience will be crucial in determining the future of David Kushner as a singer." (Read the rest here.)

Taylor Bennett

"It’s fitting that Bennett’s most recent single is titled '2 Much,' because frankly, that was his approach to his performance. There was certainly effort on Bennett’s behalf, but things didn’t really seem to click for him at the Oasis. In the course of 45 minutes, he utilized just about every audience-invoking gimmick that he could to try and get the crowd going. A pair of backup dancers hit the stage behind him for select songs, and he’d take his shirt off midway through the set to try and elicit some cheers from the crowd. He’d ask for phones and lighters up in the sky, which also fell flat, because it was still light out. Through no real fault of his own, the show failed to resonate with a crowd that formed to see him." (Read the rest here.)







Day 3
SZA

"Considering that Summerfest has a vast history dating back more than half of a century, it’s hard to say when certain nights at the festival become truly infamous. That being said, it is also very safe to say that SZA’s Saturday night show to close out the opening weekend of this year’s festival will certainly go down as one of the most memorable nights of recent Summerfest history, if not of all time. It was a night full of weather delays, celebrity sightings and also a crowning moment for one of the new queens of contemporary R&B." (Read the rest here.)

Goo Goo Dolls

"Never a die-hard fan, I went into my first Goo Goo concert in the wake of two weeks of listening to playlists filled with a selection of songs from their 14 studio albums to build familiarity with their canon. If I'm honest, I came out wondering what all the fuss was really about.

"But there was something about seeing The Goo Goo Dolls live that I can't really explain.

"What I can say is that, if music is indeed the language of emotion, there was plenty of neurochemical magic flowing throughout the 90-minute show, which offered the audience a taste of the Goo Goo canon from 1995 through 2023." (Read the rest here.)

Dawes

"With moving songs like 'A Little Bit of Everything' and 'All Your Favorite Bands,' Americana rock band Dawes knows their way around telling a good story – and they and their fans at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard on Saturday certainly have a new one to tell thanks to their night at Summerfest, thanks to dramatic storms and forecasts threatening to shut things down early before the band even got to take the stage."

MUNA

"This, however, was a much stronger MUNA than the guitar-oriented pop band that was cutting their teeth in 2017. The band is now three albums deep, playing major festivals worldwide and serving as the openers for Taylor Swift on several stops on the 'Eras' tour. They used that stadium-level experience on Thursday to deliver a tight set in every aspect, igniting shrieks from a full seating bowl at just about every turn." (Read the rest here.)

"If you felt the ground shake last night, don't worry; it wasn't an earthquake. It was Alison Wonderland warming up Summerfest for her electrifying DJ set. The booming bass, complemented by mesmerizing graphics, formed a celestial gateway that immersed the audience in Alison Wonderland's signature blend of bass, chillwave, trap and electronic-soaked airy darkness for her entire hour-long Summerfest set."

"EDM is fickle in the sense that it's very easy to have a good show, but it also doesn't take much for things to go into unsaveable territory quickly.

Most importantly, he did it as if there was no other way." (Read the rest here.)

"When Urban did take a quick timeout to chat with the crowd, it was just as pleasant and compelling. The man has a calm, low-key charm and charisma on stage that feels authentic and unforced – whether he's interviewing a local couple about their upcoming wedding (more on that in a second ... ), leading a 'Freddie Mercury at Live Aid'-esque call-and-answer or chatting with his bandmates about their glorious first Summerfest ... playing at 11 a.m. Even if you hate country music, Urban puts on a personable and impressive show that's easy to love."

"Yesterday may have marked a national holiday, but AJR wasn’t in the mood to relax or take any time off Thursday night, instead working overtime to entertain the mostly full Fourth of July crowd gathered at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater. Yes, the July 3rd fireworks may have been a no-show this year, but the trio of hit-making brothers and their brassy band kindly brought their own kind of grandiose and colorful display to the lakefront in its place – fittingly complete with plenty of oohs and ahhs as well as maybe a few fizzles and misfires too."

Sueco

"I hate encores. At least I hate the broken modern version of them, where everyone has to pretend the band's not going to play the rest of their set – including sometimes their biggest songs – without the audience paying some silly applause tax to bring them back out. It's all so cumbersome and contrived.

And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article.

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

"It’s fitting that Bennett’s most recent single is titled '2 Much,' because frankly, that was his approach to his performance. There was certainly effort on Bennett’s behalf, but things didn’t really seem to click for him at the Oasis. In the course of 45 minutes, he utilized just about every audience-invoking gimmick that he could to try and get the crowd going. A pair of backup dancers hit the stage behind him for select songs, and he’d take his shirt off midway through the set to try and elicit some cheers from the crowd. He’d ask for phones and lighters up in the sky, which also fell flat, because it was still light out. Through no real fault of his own, the show failed to resonate with a crowd that formed to see him." (Read the rest here.)

That being said, it is also very safe to say that SZA’s Saturday night show to close out the opening weekend of this year’s festival will certainly go down as one of the most memorable nights of recent Summerfest history, if not of all time. It was a night full of weather delays, celebrity sightings and also a crowning moment for one of the new queens of contemporary R&B." (Read the rest here.)

Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue.

"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

"Craig Finn, frontman for The Hold Steady, once said "irony is certainly not something I want to be accused of,” and after witnessing him perform on the Miller Lite Oasis Saturday night, that accusation is never gonna happen. Finn – with his four bandmates (two of whom were celebrating a birthday) – ripped through 15 songs during the hour set with energetic earnesty. His endearing nerdy movements were in full force, with an abundance of exaggerated pointing and wide spread arms." (Read the rest here.)

Key Glock

"When he was onstage and focused, Key Glock showed all of the potential of a stadium-filling rapper with loyal fans. There certainly seems to be a lot invested in his live show. However, when that focus was gone, as it seemed to be on the back half of Saturday's set, it felt like a wasted opportunity. Hopefully it was just an off night." (Read the rest here.)

Day 7
AJR

"Yesterday may have marked a national holiday, but AJR wasn’t in the mood to relax or take any time off Thursday night, instead working overtime to entertain the mostly full Fourth of July crowd gathered at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater. Yes, the July 3rd fireworks may have been a no-show this year, but the trio of hit-making brothers and their brassy band kindly brought their own kind of grandiose and colorful display to the lakefront in its place – fittingly complete with plenty of oohs and ahhs as well as maybe a few fizzles and misfires too."

Sueco

"As a patch of rain trickled down on the Summerfest grounds, fans trickled into the Generac Power Stage area to see pop punk/hip hop hybrid Sueco on Thursday at Summerfest. Before the end of his set, that crowd would build to a small flood, and for good reason." (Read the rest here.)

Local Natives

"I hate encores. At least I hate the broken modern version of them, where everyone has to pretend the band's not going to play the rest of their set – including sometimes their biggest songs – without the audience paying some silly applause tax to bring them back out. It's all so cumbersome and contrived.







"But when you get a real encore? A genuine moment where the mutual musical love between the crowd and the band inspires a truly unexpected bonus final bow? That's the stuff musical memories are made of – and that's what happened Friday night at Local Natives." (Read the rest here.)

Day 9
Lil Uzi Vert

"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

"Though they’ve performed here pretty regularly in recent years, with a Summerfest show in 2021 and a State Fair gig in 2018, plus indoor gigs in 2023 and 2016, I haven’t seen Living Colour since its Milwaukee debut at the UW-Milwaukee Union Ballroom in 1988. Frankly, though their hair – and mine – is much greyer, they haven’t lost a step."

"In between rocking out to their hits, Glenn took a few moments to share personal anecdotes on his journey to stardom with the crowd. He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

"The lead singer, Nathan Willett, seemed possessed by the music, allowing the sounds to flow over, around and through him until it became one with him.

Quad City DJs
"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

"Shock G, the memorable face and voice of the group, unfortunately passed in 2021, so “Young Hump” – aka Chris Clarke – now dons the iconic nose and glasses on stage alongside fellow original member Money-B. And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article.

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

"This, however, was a much stronger MUNA than the guitar-oriented pop band that was cutting their teeth in 2017. The band is now three albums deep, playing major festivals worldwide and serving as the openers for Taylor Swift on several stops on the 'Eras' tour. They used that stadium-level experience on Thursday to deliver a tight set in every aspect, igniting shrieks from a full seating bowl at just about every turn." (Read the rest here.)

"When Urban did take a quick timeout to chat with the crowd, it was just as pleasant and compelling. The man has a calm, low-key charm and charisma on stage that feels authentic and unforced – whether he's interviewing a local couple about their upcoming wedding (more on that in a second ... ), leading a 'Freddie Mercury at Live Aid'-esque call-and-answer or chatting with his bandmates about their glorious first Summerfest ... playing at 11 a.m. Even if you hate country music, Urban puts on a personable and impressive show that's easy to love."

His endearing nerdy movements were in full force, with an abundance of exaggerated pointing and wide spread arms." (Read the rest here.)

"Yesterday may have marked a national holiday, but AJR wasn’t in the mood to relax or take any time off Thursday night, instead working overtime to entertain the mostly full Fourth of July crowd gathered at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater. Yes, the July 3rd fireworks may have been a no-show this year, but the trio of hit-making brothers and their brassy band kindly brought their own kind of grandiose and colorful display to the lakefront in its place – fittingly complete with plenty of oohs and ahhs as well as maybe a few fizzles and misfires too."

Lil Uzi Vert

"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

Quad City DJs
"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article.

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

"It's no surprise that Asher has risen to fame with his unique mix of club beats and hit songs. His set, which often feature unexpected mashups like AC/DC with iconic club beats, kept the Summerfest crowd dancing for well over an hour. Asher's infectious energy and enthusiasm, evident as he dances and sings along with the crowd, made this performance feel like a shared celebration." (Read the rest here.)

"Though they’ve performed here pretty regularly in recent years, with a Summerfest show in 2021 and a State Fair gig in 2018, plus indoor gigs in 2023 and 2016, I haven’t seen Living Colour since its Milwaukee debut at the UW-Milwaukee Union Ballroom in 1988. Frankly, though their hair – and mine – is much greyer, they haven’t lost a step."

"In between rocking out to their hits, Glenn took a few moments to share personal anecdotes on his journey to stardom with the crowd. He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

"The lead singer, Nathan Willett, seemed possessed by the music, allowing the sounds to flow over, around and through him until it became one with him. The concert was more than just a performance; it was an experience where the music and the performers melded into something greater than the songs they played." (Read the rest here.)

Quad City DJs
"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

"Shock G, the memorable face and voice of the group, unfortunately passed in 2021, so “Young Hump” – aka Chris Clarke – now dons the iconic nose and glasses on stage alongside fellow original member Money-B. And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article. It's just a tall task to try and authentically recapture such a one-of-a-kind, uniquely oddball persona." (Read the rest here.)

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

"When Urban did take a quick timeout to chat with the crowd, it was just as pleasant and compelling. The man has a calm, low-key charm and charisma on stage that feels authentic and unforced – whether he's interviewing a local couple about their upcoming wedding (more on that in a second ... ), leading a 'Freddie Mercury at Live Aid'-esque call-and-answer or chatting with his bandmates about their glorious first Summerfest ... playing at 11 a.m. Even if you hate country music, Urban puts on a personable and impressive show that's easy to love."

"Craig Finn, frontman for The Hold Steady, once said "irony is certainly not something I want to be accused of,” and after witnessing him perform on the Miller Lite Oasis Saturday night, that accusation is never gonna happen. Finn – with his four bandmates (two of whom were celebrating a birthday) – ripped through 15 songs during the hour set with energetic earnesty. His endearing nerdy movements were in full force, with an abundance of exaggerated pointing and wide spread arms." (Read the rest here.)

Yes, the July 3rd fireworks may have been a no-show this year, but the trio of hit-making brothers and their brassy band kindly brought their own kind of grandiose and colorful display to the lakefront in its place – fittingly complete with plenty of oohs and ahhs as well as maybe a few fizzles and misfires too."

At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue.

And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article.

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later."

"Yesterday may have marked a national holiday, but AJR wasn’t in the mood to relax or take any time off Thursday night, instead working overtime to entertain the mostly full Fourth of July crowd gathered at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater. Yes, the July 3rd fireworks may have been a no-show this year, but the trio of hit-making brothers and their brassy band kindly brought their own kind of grandiose and colorful display to the lakefront in its place – fittingly complete with plenty of oohs and ahhs as well as maybe a few fizzles and misfires too."

"As a patch of rain trickled down on the Summerfest grounds, fans trickled into the Generac Power Stage area to see pop punk/hip hop hybrid Sueco on Thursday at Summerfest. Before the end of his set, that crowd would build to a small flood, and for good reason." (Read the rest here.)

Local Natives

"I hate encores. At least I hate the broken modern version of them, where everyone has to pretend the band's not going to play the rest of their set – including sometimes their biggest songs – without the audience paying some silly applause tax to bring them back out. It's all so cumbersome and contrived.







"But when you get a real encore? A genuine moment where the mutual musical love between the crowd and the band inspires a truly unexpected bonus final bow? That's the stuff musical memories are made of – and that's what happened Friday night at Local Natives." (Read the rest here.)

Lil Uzi Vert

"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

"In between rocking out to their hits, Glenn took a few moments to share personal anecdotes on his journey to stardom with the crowd. He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."

"Shock G, the memorable face and voice of the group, unfortunately passed in 2021, so “Young Hump” – aka Chris Clarke – now dons the iconic nose and glasses on stage alongside fellow original member Money-B. And while he did an enthusiastic job and sounded close enough to the part on stage (one could say he did not ruin the image and the style that you’re used to) it couldn’t help feeling more like the cover band version of Humpty rather than the lived-in, genuine article. It's just a tall task to try and authentically recapture such a one-of-a-kind, uniquely oddball persona." (Read the rest here.)

"While the current touring lineup’s pretty distant from the classic group, you wouldn’t know it from Saturday’s performance. Between Williams’ low assertive raps and Jammy’s powerful vocals – even with what looked like another batch of mic and monitor gremlins near the end – the duo confidently and capably kept the still-crowded Pavilion on their feet through time-tested dance floor anthems like 'Things That Make You Go Hmmm,' 'Do You Wanna Get Funky' and even a quick cover of iNi Kamoze’s 'Here Comes the Hotstepper.' Oh, and obviously 'Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),' their most monstrous hit and a spirited sports arena staple even decades later." (Read the rest here.)

      
"When you have the better part of 20,000 fans to sing every one of your words back at the stage, you don’t have to do much work. Frankly, Lil Uzi Vert didn’t on Saturday, opting to keep the mic to the side for roughly half of their verses, and playing the role of head curator of vibes instead of trying to out-rap the rest of the bill. At one point, they rolled the microphone to the side, for production to replace it with a new one, but that didn't seem to really be the issue. What they lacked in vocal performance, they made up for in energy, by running from side to side on stage for the better part of 45 minutes, stoking the fire of a crowd that didn’t need much coaxing."

"Though they’ve performed here pretty regularly in recent years, with a Summerfest show in 2021 and a State Fair gig in 2018, plus indoor gigs in 2023 and 2016, I haven’t seen Living Colour since its Milwaukee debut at the UW-Milwaukee Union Ballroom in 1988. Frankly, though their hair – and mine – is much greyer, they haven’t lost a step."

"In between rocking out to their hits, Glenn took a few moments to share personal anecdotes on his journey to stardom with the crowd. He reminisced about Neon Trees' first Summerfest appearance in 2010, where he dressed as Captain EO and was so overwhelmed by the crowd's support that he called his mom in tears afterward. He shared that is why Milwaukee had his heart. The band has been back a resounding six times to Summerfest. Neon Trees just can’t get enough of Milwaukee." (Read the rest here.)

"The lead singer, Nathan Willett, seemed possessed by the music, allowing the sounds to flow over, around and through him until it became one with him. The concert was more than just a performance; it was an experience where the music and the performers melded into something greater than the songs they played." (Read the rest here.)

Quad City DJs
"The Florida-based hip-hop tandem earned their paycheck Saturday afternoon, throwing a hell of a mid-day retro dance party featuring some of the best Jock Jams of yore – including both 'Whoot' and 'Whoomp' as well as 'Tootsee Roll' (a 69 Boyz song that they produced). After polling the crowd on their preferred 'Space Jam' movie – a landslide, with the sequel predictably coming in with sub-RFK Jr. numbers – the duo busted out both the original still-beloved theme song as well as an unreleased remixed versionfrom the long-anticipated, short-remembered LeBron-led sequel."
