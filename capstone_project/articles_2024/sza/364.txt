Ariana Grande’s “Yes, And?” soars in at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the pop superstar’s eighth career leader on the chart.

	The song is the lead single from Grande’s seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine, due March 8 (as announced Jan. 17).

	Grande wrote and produced “Yes, And?” with Max Martin and ILYA. With its Hot 100 triumph, Martin makes history, as he passes George Martin for the most No. 1s among producers – 24 – ever on the chart.

	Max Martin also ties John Lennon for the second-most Hot 100 No. 1s among writers – 26 each – after only Paul McCartney’s 32.

	Additionally in the Hot 100’s top 10, 21 Savage debuts two songs: “Redrum,” at No. 5, and “Née-nah,” with Travis Scott and Metro Boomin, at No. 10. The tracks are from 21 Savage’s LP American Dream, which bounds in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.

	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Jan. 27, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Jan. 23.

	“Yes, And?,” on Republic Records, becomes the 1,162nd No. 1 in the Hot 100’s 65-year archives, and the 74th to debut at the summit.

	Here’s a look at its coronation.

Streams, airplay & sales: Released Jan. 12, “Yes, And?” drew 27.2 million streams and 24.8 million radio airplay audience impressions and sold 53,000, including 41,000 digital downloads, in the Jan. 12-18 tracking week, according to Luminate.

	The single launches at No. 1 on both the Streaming Songs and Digital Song Sales charts, where Grande ups her totals to five and nine leaders, respectively, and No. 28 on Radio Songs.

	The track was available for purchase via 14 digital iterations, all for 69 cents by the end of the tracking week: its original version, an edit, an extended mix, an a cappella version and slowed and sped up mixes, each in clean and explicit options, as well instrumental and extended mix instrumental versions.

Grande’s eighth Hot 100 No. 1: Grande earns her eighth Hot 100 No. 1. It’s her first since “Die for You,” with The Weeknd, last March, and her first on her own since “Positions” in November 2020. (She notches her sixth No. 1  debut, following her first five leaders, as she ties Taylor Swift for the most among women; Drake leads all acts with nine chart-topping entrances.)

Ariana Grande’s Hot 100 No. 1s:











	Grande ties Beyoncé for the eighth-most Hot 100 No. 1s among solo women. Mariah Carey leads all women soloists with 19, followed by Rihanna (14), Madonna (12), Whitney Houston, Taylor Swift (11 each), Janet Jackson (10) and Katy Perry (nine).

Max Martin solely claims most Hot 100 No. 1s among producers: Grande co-wrote and co-produced “Yes, And?” with Max Martin and ILYA. She earns her eighth Hot 100 No. 1 as a writer and her first as a producer. ILYA adds his second leader as both a writer and producer, after Sam Smith and Kim Petras’ “Unholy,” for a week in 2022.

	Meanwhile, with its arrival atop the Hot 100, Martin makes history, passing the late George Martin – who produced 19 of The Beatles’ record 20 No. 1s – for the most leaders among producers ever on the chart: 24.

Most Hot 100 No. 1s Among Producers:

	Max Martin also ties the late John Lennon for the second-most Hot 100 No. 1s among writers, 26 each, after only Paul McCartney’s 32. (McCartney and Lennon co-penned all 20 of The Beatles’ No. 1s.)

Most Hot 100 No. 1s Among Writers:











	Max Martin first dominated the Hot 100 both as a producer and writer 25 years ago this month, when Britney Spears’ debut smash “…Baby One More Time” hit No. 1 on the Jan. 30, 1999-dated chart.

‘Yes,’ it’s No. 1, ‘And’ a first: “Yes, And?” is the first Hot 100 No. 1 with the word “yes” in its title. It one-ups Teri DeSario’s “Yes, I’m Ready” (with K.C.), which hit No. 2 in March 1980.

	Honorable mention: 40 years ago, the band Yes ruled the Hot 100 with “Owner of a Lonely Heart,” for two weeks in January 1984.

	(Not to sound negative … but 10 singles with “no” in their titles have topped the Hot 100, from The Rolling Stones’ “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” in 1965 through Alicia Keys’ “No One” in 2007.)

No. 1 on Hot Dance/Electronic Songs: “Yes, And?” concurrently opens at No. 1 on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, which uses the same methodology as the Hot 100.

	Grande posts her first Hot Dance/Electronic Songs leader on her own, and her third overall, following “Rain on Me,” with Lady Gaga (two weeks at No. 1, 2020), and “Break Free,” featuring Zedd (nine, 2014).

	Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me” dips to No. 2 after three weeks atop the Hot 100. Meanwhile, it ascends to No. 1 on Radio Songs (67 million, up 15%), becoming his second leader, after “First Class” (four weeks, 2022). “Lovin on Me” tops the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts for a 10th week each.

	Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” slips 2-3 on the Hot 100, following four nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in October, and Tate McRae’s “Greedy” backtracks to No. 4 from its No. 3 best.

	21 Savage debuts two songs in the Hot 100’s top 10: “Redrum,” at No. 5, and “Née-nah,” with Travis Scott and Metro Boomin, at No. 10. The tracks start with 21.4 and 18 million streams, respectively.

	21 Savage tallies his 16th and 17th Hot 100 top 10s – with “Redrum” marking his first with no accompanying artists. Travis Scott scores his 15th top 10 and Metro Boomin, his fifth.

	Zach Bryan’s “I Remember Everything,” featuring Kacey Musgraves, falls 4-6 on the Hot 100, after it led for a week upon its debut last September, as it rules the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs charts for a 21st week each and Hot Country Songs for a 17th frame.

	










	Doja Cat’s “Paint the Town Red” descends 5-7 on the Hot 100, after it led for three nonconsecutive weeks beginning in September; Teddy Swims’ “Lose Control” holds at its No. 8 high, a week after it became his first top 10; and SZA’s “Snooze” drifts 6-9, after reaching No. 2, as it leads the multimetric Hot R&B Songs chart for a 25th week.
