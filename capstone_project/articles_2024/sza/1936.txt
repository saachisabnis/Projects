	Kendrick Lamar surprised fans when he unveiled his sixth studio album, GNX, without any warning on Friday (Nov. 22) via PGLang and Interscope. 

	The 12-track project is named after the Buick Regal model and features collaborations with stars including Lefty Gunplay, Dody 6, Wallie the Sensei, Roddy Ricch, Siete7x, AzChike, Hitta J3, YoungThreat, Peysoh and SZA — who appears on the tracks “Luther” and “Gloria.” It also boasts Jack Antonoff, Sounwave, Mustard, Kamasi Washington, M-Tech and more as co-producers alongside Lamar. GNX serves as Lamar’s official follow-up to Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers in 2022, which topped the Billboard 200 with 295,000 total units earned in the first week. He also added a pair of Hot 100 No. 1 hits to his name in 2024 thanks to his collaboration with Future and Metro Boomin, “Like That,” as well as “Not Like Us.”

	The album also arrives just months before Lamar is set to take the stage for the Super Bowl LIX Halftime Show on Feb. 9, 2025, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The 17-time Grammy winner is also up for seven awards at the 2025 ceremony. “Not Like Us” is up for record of the year, song of the year, best music video, best rap performance and best rap song. Meanwhile, “Like That” is nominated for best rap song and best rap performance.
