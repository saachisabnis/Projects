SZA has revealed that comedian Katt Williams called her “mentally ill” while they were filming a new movie together.
The TDE songstress sat down with Kendrick Lamar for an interview in Harper’s Bazaar that was published on Monday (October 21) and shared the memorable anecdote.

While making such a comment about somebody’s mental wellbeing might ordinarily cause offense, SZA said the famously sharp-tongued comedian actually meant it as a “compliment.”
“We shot a movie last night. I’ve never shot a movie before, so I was freaking out. It’s a lot of being scared to be myself. I’m either gonna pretend it never happened or not show up to the premiere,” she said.

“I met Katt Williams [on set]. He told me I was mentally ill, like, as a compliment. He was like, ‘Sa, I believe you might have some mental—’ And I was like, ‘Illness?’ And he was like, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Oh, welcome.'”
The film in question is an upcoming buddy comedy starring SZA and Keke Palmer.
