	The film came together from the CoCre lab at Sony Pictures. The lab was a previous pact between ColorCreative and Sony Pictures to source and incubate emerging, diverse screenwriters to develop and write their first studio feature based on original ideas.

	“We are enormously excited to add Joshua Neal to the ColorCreative family”, says ColorCreative’s co-head of talent Danielle Robinson. “We were blown away by his creativity when we discovered his short films and original content a few years ago. He has a bright future ahead of him and we are honored to be able to amplify him as an actor, writer and creator.”

	ColorCreative was founded in 2020 to foster creativity and elevate the voices of multidimensional talent within the entertainment industry. Neal’s signing underscores ColorCreative’s commitment to identifying, developing and amplifying the voices of Hollywood’s most promising rising talent of color. 

	Other ColorCreative clients include Avantika (“Mean Girls”), Charlotte Ritchie (“You”), Lashana Lynch (“Bob Marley: One Love”) and Teyonah Parris (“The Marvels”).
