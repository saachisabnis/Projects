	Earlier this month, Flo posted an Instagram clip previewing a song sampling T-Pain’s “I’m In Luv (Wit a Stripper),” and fans noticed a part of the video in which featured a man rubbing what appeared to be a baby bump.

	She later addressed the pregnancy rumors, claiming to be “bloated” at the time on X. “Damn I can’t be bloated????” she asked.
