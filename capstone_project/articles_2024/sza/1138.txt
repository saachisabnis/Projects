The only wins Billie deserves are Best New Artist and even though I despise What Was I Made For? She did deserve to win this year’s SOTY. The rest of her wins in the GF are absolutely attrocious. 
A Taylor stan would know about atrocious wins.
Everything is khia stats if it’s not from Taylor huh 😉 You’re just mad as fuck that TTPD is long forgotten
long forgotten sis? Still top 10 on billboard? The best selling album of the year, 12 weeks at number one! ☝️ 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

Ask general audience to name one song from that album
 I’ve been thinking about your statement ever since I read it for the first time, because I completely disagree. May I ask you why? Also, what would you have chosen, amongst the nominees? 
I would choose Kill Bill, Vampire or Butterfly amongst the nominees. I didn’t liked the song, i find it boring. I know it’s about the themes of Barbie but still i find it overrated. Kill Bill is about literally killing your ex and his new girlfriend but not necessarily they did wrong to you, SZA’s the villain in this story. That’s what i like about it, it’s not a revenge song about some asshole ex. Butterfly was about Jon Batiste’s wife on chemotherapy. That’s definitely most meaningful and message heavy song on that lineup.
Billie’s win for Song of the Year last year is probably her most deserving Grammy win ever outside of Best new Artist. You guys are delusional. 
Imagine calling someone delusional over they didn’t like some overrated movie song by a white pop artist. Couldn’t be me.
I'm making love to the angels of death,
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps.
I get the song content part, but that’s not all that songwriting is about, it it? “What Was I Made For?” encapsulated the script of an entire movie and at the same time is relatable for people of all ages, if you want to discuss just that. “Vampire” is “Driver’s License (Blinding Lights remix)”, “Kill Bill” is quite silly based on your take on it (similarly to “Bad Guy”) and “Butterfly” may sound a little boring. “What Was I Made For?” was the deserving winner.
However, I feel like we will share the same feeling cause I will not be happy when “Die With a Smile” sweeps everything. And that’s fine.
when you saw the dead little bird you started crying, but you know the killer doesn’t understand • how did I go from growing up to breaking down? • old habits die screaming • girl, how do you feel being a girl? • things I once enjoyed just keep me employed now • meet me behind the mall
Me…I’ll go on the side of the magazines and critics and defend A&W no matter what.
(And sorry Paramore but you guys just deserved the Rock Album win).
It's me... Hi

It’s not relatable for me and i’m not a big Barbie movie fan. Did you compared Vampire to Blinding Lights, that’s funny. Whatever you say, Kill Bill was clever for the reasons i said and i don’t like Die With a Smile too. I’m fucking tired of same people winning and I’m not on the Billie Eilish hype like the rest of you guys. That’s all.

The real SOTY last year was Escapism and that wasn’t even nominated.
Of the nominees I would’ve voted for Kill Bill (or Butterfly) but WWIMF is a very deserving winner

this. This site is full of clowns and shit. All is fair and game when it comes to the critiques of other pop girls. God forbid someone say something negative or have an opinion about Billie, this place goes into uproar. 
Congratulations to 4 Time Grammy Album of the Year Winner Taylor Swift!!!

Escapism is a great fucking song, i would root for it if that was nominated.

Billie has way more undeserved wins in the Gf than swift and that’s a fact. At least all four of Taylor’s AOTY make sense and are supported by impact, sales and acclaim. There’s no reason for Billie to have won Grammys for trash like bad guy, when we all fall asleep and everything I wanted. Absolute was of a win. And this is why I can’t stand her and the hype. She’s not that great.

Sis, I actually feel like if someone say any nice thing about Taylor they are immediately scrutinized. The Billie and her wins conversation has been quite respectful. But if I say I love and find TTPD to be at least good…

Gurl, nobody take you seriously. Taylor is the epitom of not that great and extremely overrated. She only deserved AotY 2 times max. Fearless and Midnights are trash and aged like milk.

I’m happy that you don’t relate to it. It’s a sign that your mental health and understanding of yourself is doing good. But you can’t deny that most people are not at that place. And generally, it makes it relatable to the majority of people.
I feel like Billie gets hype when she earns it. All her music videos has been criticized here (alongside “Lunch” (S)) this era, and album tracks from Happier Than Ever. But the album (HIT ME HARD AND SOFT) has been praised because it’s an actual great body of work.
On the bright note, let’s pray together that voters see through the formulaic “Die With A Smile” and vote for anything else.

It’s not about my mental health, i still listen and cry to Mother I Sober and U by Kendrick. It’s a heavier song compared to WWIMF. I can relate to that and i understand if most of you guys relate to WWIMF. Users on GD or General Public has always praised Billie except other artists stans. Happier than Ever voted for the Best Album of 2021 for example. Hit Me Hard and Soft will probably have the same reception. That’s what i meant i’m not on the hype like the rest of you guys, i don’t like Taylor winning or Bruno winning too, i’m just tired of the same, repetitive winners.
