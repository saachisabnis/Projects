RALEIGH, N.C.  (WTVD) -- The countdown to Dreamville Festival is just a day away.
Raleigh's Dorthea Dix Park is closed on Friday as the final touches are being put together, gearing up for the weekend's festival.
But, the excitement starts today.
All week-long crews at the park have worked to assemble each stage, the Ferris wheel and other attractions on the big field.
Local businesses have also been preparing.
Earlier in the week, ABC11 learned last year's festival brought in $145 million. Tourism officials are expecting another 100,000 people all over the world to come back to the Oak City.
Unorthodox Vintage is bringing in additional inventory.
They're one of the vendors participating in a free public block party outside of CAM Raleigh Museum in the Warehouse District the Friday before Dreamville.
