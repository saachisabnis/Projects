SZA plans to take a step back from the stage to give herself some self-care. The Grammy award-winning artist has blessed stages all around the world for well over a year. In a message she posted to X on Monday night, August 5, provided fans with an update shortly after she headlined the final night of Osheaga Festival in Montreal. She declared that her latest festival performance was the last time she'd be on stage "for a while." "Yesterday was my last show for a while," SZA wrote. "Finally bout to get my life together thank u God ." 
Earlier this year, SZA wrapped up her massive "SOS Tour" that kicked off in the U.S. and traveled to Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Australia. The overall tour lasted from February 2023 to May 2024. The massive string of shows was considered one of the highest-grossing R&B tours of 2023 after it racked up over $95.5 million. Although she had brief breaks during her international tour run, SZA still had other on-stage work to do. Within the past few months alone, she performed at Glastonbury in the U.K. as well as Lollapalooza in both Brazil and Chicago â€” the latter performance happened on the same weekend as her last set in Montreal. SZA also hit the stage at nationally broadcasted shows like the 2024 Grammy Awards. During the awards show, the Top Dawg Ent signee performed her latest single "Saturn" for the first time. The song is set to appear on her upcoming album LANA. As of this report, there's no word on when the album will arrive. In the meantime, SZA could use a solid break before she returns with new music.
