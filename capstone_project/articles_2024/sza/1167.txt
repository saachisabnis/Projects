The Fleetwood Mac icon returns to the capital this summer as part of her 2024 UK and Ireland tour
Stevie Nicks has announced the first wave of special guests for her forthcoming show at London’s BST Hyde Park – find all the details below.
The Fleetwood Mac legend is due to play a solo headline set at the concert series on Friday, July 12. It comes as part of her 2024 UK and Ireland tour, which kicks off in Dublin earlier that month.
Today (April 23), it’s been confirmed that Brandi Carlile will support Nicks at Hyde Park this summer. Also on the bill are Anna Calvi and Paris Paloma, with “many more” acts still to be announced.
Writing on social media, Carlile said: “When @stevienicks asks, you get on the plane. London, it’s been too long. 🇬🇧 💂 I cannot wait to see your sunburns at @bsthydepark this summer. Who’s coming?… apart from my mother-in-law and all of Catherine’s friends?”
Paloma wrote: “I’m beyond excited to be supporting @stevienicks at @bsthydepark this summer as well as @brandicarlile and @annacalvi ❤️‍🔥 This is an absolute dream come true and I still can’t quite believe it, what LEGENDS. Can’t wait to see you there 🌟.”

Earlier this year, both Nicks and Carlile contributed to Dolly Parton‘s star-studded album ‘Rockstar’ alongside the likes of Paul McCartney, Debbie Harry and Elton John. Carlile has also previously spoken about Fleetwood Mac’s influence on her music.
She explained in 2015 (via Scene): “I always really liked Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks in particular. I have a penchant for their drama. I live in a band that is also my family. Things can get really strange and I love that about bands.”
In a statement in February about her upcoming BST show, Nicks said: “Anything that draws me back to London – and therefore to England – fills my heart with joy. And to be able to visit and make music… is always a dream come true.”

This year’s edition will also host headline performances from the likes of SZA, Kings Of Leon, Kylie Minogue, Shania Twain, Stray Kids and Robbie Williams.

In other news, Nicks has written a poem to accompany the physical version of Taylor Swift’s new album ‘The Tortured Poets Department’.
Stevie Nicks explained last autumn that “there’s no reason” for Fleetwood Mac to return following Christine McVie’s death because “you can’t replace her”. She said: “When she died, I figured we really can’t go any further with this.”
