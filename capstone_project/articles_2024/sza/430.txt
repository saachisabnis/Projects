Former NFL wide receiver and current meme poster Antonio Brown got a taste of his own social media meme medicine courtesy of rapper Sexyy Red.
Sexyy Red, real name Janae Nierah Wherry, is a 25-year-old rapper from St. Louis known for her 2023 single “Pound Town.” She’s certainly not A Tribe Called Quest, to say the least.
Her dissing skills were solid enough, however, to clap back at Brown with a devastating CTE joke after Brown commented on a video of her saying that she “stank.”

Sexyy Red is also known for her single “SkeeYee” and her guest appearances on tracks such as “Shake Sumn” by DaBaby, “Slut Me Out” by NLE Choppa, “Peaches & Eggplants” by Young Nudy, and “Rich Baby Daddy” by Drake and SZA.
Sexyy Red is just the latest celebrity that Brown has taken shots on at Twitter, as recent weeks and months have seen him poke fun at Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Adam Schefter, Taylor Swift, Shannon Sharpe, President Biden, Dave Portnoy, and more.
Brown has been attempting to use Twitter and memes to build up his @CTESPN account, which is being used to post sports jokes and seemingly legitimate sports news.
Last week, for example, @CTESPN tweeted about Russell Wilson signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers before Adam Schefter reported it. Then, earlier today — a day after the Sexyy Red exchange — he posted a tweet claiming the Steelers are on the verge of trading for San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk.
