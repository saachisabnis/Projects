Sabatino's in Maplewood, where SZA purchased lunch for students at her alma mater, Columbia High School, on Tuesday.Jeremy Schneider | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com
If you think high school kids love free pizza, you should see what happens when its a music superstar who’s buying.
Sabatino’s, a pizzeria in Maplewood, was mobbed by Columbia High School Students for hours on Tuesday. The crowds came after SZA, the Grammy-winning singer and Maplewood native, posted on social media that she was buying lunch for all the students at her alma mater, and teased that she might stop by.
“SZA called me up yesterday, and she wanted to buy lunch for the high school,” Sabatino’s owner Sabatino Perotta, a fellow Maplewood native, told NJ Advance Media on Tuesday. “We kind of know each other. I’m not going to say I’m her best friend, but she knows who I am and my family. She’s giving back to the community.”
The free lunch started around 11 a.m., and hordes of students soon followed. The crowds initially spilled into Valley Street, before Maplewood Police officers ordered the students to form an orderly line that stretched far down the block. Some students skipped class to give themselves extra lunch periods.

Sure, the kids were there for the pizza — anyone with a student ID was given two free slices and a drink. But the countless SZA shirts and albums those students brought to the pizzeria made it clear they were more interested in catching a peak of their school’s most famous alum, Solana Rowe.
“If you live in Maplewood or South Orange tomorrow the high school kids eat free at (Sabatino’s) for lunch!” SZA wrote in an Instagram story on Monday. “I might also slide by.”
Fueled by her social media hints, buzz outside the pizzeria all day was that SZA herself might make an appearance. That buzz intensified when SZA’s father, Abdul Mubarak-Rowe, arrived at Sabatino’s in the early afternoon. It reached a fever pitch when police officers set up barricades in front of the pizzeria in anticipation of her arrival. Mubarak-Rowe signed autographs and took pictures with students, some writing down their phone number with hopes he would pass it along to his daughter.

“I had doctor’s appointment but I’m headed over now lol I hope y’all enjoyed!” SZA wrote on Instagram on Tuesday. “Love my town.”
About an hour after the post, SZA hadn’t arrived. After more than an hour of students waiting at the barricades and shrieking anytime a car drove up in hopes SZA was inside, police told the crowd she was not coming.
That changed a few hours later when she did show up to grab what looked like chicken parmesan from the eatery, according to her Instagram story.
“Thank you!” she wrote as she posted a picture of her melty, cheesy meal.
SZA also posed for photos with fans and Sabatino’s staff when she came to pick up her food, which the pizzerias posted to social media.

A 2008 graduate of Columbia High School, SZA rose to fame in 2017 with the release of her critically acclaimed debut album “CTRL,” which earned the versatile singer her first five Grammy nominations. SZA’s profile continued to rise in subsequent years — namely due to features on songs with Kendrick Lamar and Doja Cat; the latter earned SZA her first Grammy in 2022.
But the singer reached mainstream superstar status last year, following the release of her monstrously successful followup album “SOS,” which topped the Billboard albums chart for 10 non-consecutive weeks (a record at the time), notched her first No. 1 single with “Kill Bill,” and earned her three more Grammys.
SZA’s sold-out “SOS” arena tour visited Prudential Center in Newark last fall, where she was sure to note: “So, I went to Columbia High School.”
Her next album is reportedly titled “Lana.” A release date has not been announced.
