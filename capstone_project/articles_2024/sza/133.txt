SZA has revealed her regrets over getting plastic surgery - specifically her BBL (Brazilian Butt Lift), saying: 'It was just so stupid'. 
The singer, 35, real name Solána Imani Rowe, spoke of her feelings since having the procedure with Vogue as she covered their December issue on Thursday.
In the candid accompanying interview she spoke on a wide range of subjects including her surgery regrets, love life and her Muslim upbringing.
On getting a BBL she said: 'I'm so mad I did that s***. I gained all this weight from being immobile while recovering and trying to preserve the fat. It was just so stupid. But who gives a f**k? 
'You got a BBL, you realise you didn't need the s**t. It doesn't matter. I'll do a whole bunch more s**t just like it if I want to before I'm f***ing dead because this body is temporary.

The singer, 35, real name Solána Imani Rowe, spoke of her feelings since having the procedure with Vogue as she covered their December issue on Thursday (seen in April 2024)
'It just wasn't super necessary – I have other s**t that I need to work on about myself… I need to get my f***ing mental health together… Not to say you can't do those things simultaneously, just, for me, I realise wherever you go, there you'll be.
'But I love my butt. Don't get me wrong. My booty look nice. And I'm grateful that it looks pretty much… I don't know, sometimes natural, but I don't even care. It's something that I wanted. I'm enjoying it. I love shaking it.'
During the interview she also spoke about deciding to stop wearing a hijab after 9/11 due to the Islamophobia she received.
The singer, who grew up in a Muslim household in a predominantly white community in New Jersey, said that stopping 'caused a lot of weird energy with her dad'.  
She added: 'I started feeling so much shame and wanted to disassociate myself, because I just was already getting bullied for being a weird b***h.'
The star previously said of her decision to stop wearing it: 'I stopped covering after 9/11 because I was so scared.
'This was like elementary school, middle school. I regret so much – like being afraid or caring what people said about me.'
She said that she started wearing the hijab again in high school but she felt judged by the community for not being devout enough.

'They were like, 'What is this? You don't live your life properly. You're not really Muslim. Shut up.' I always let somebody dictate how I was,' she said in 2021.
SZA made headlines over the summer for her Glastonbury performance where she failed to draw in big crowds.
After the festival she posted a cryptic message about the 'bravery' needed to be 'in public'.
The US hitmaker spoke out after her set was blighted by sound issues while a significantly smaller crowd watched her in action on the famous Pyramid Stage. 
Footage from the festival showed a noticeably smaller audience than had been in attendance. 
The singer took to Twitter the day after her performance and wrote: 'The bravery required to be alive in public is remarkable. S/o everybody doing that s**t'. 
SZA did not elaborate on the tweet but followed it up with a post thanking those who turned up to her performance. 
Now she has told Vogue: 'I just felt like nothing I could do would be enough for Glastonbury, no matter what I did.
'It scared me. I was like, well, I wish I wasn't doing it, but I couldn't walk away from it…
'I want to be the second Black woman in history, but then it's such a fucking tall order. It's like, no matter what you do here, you will be subject to criticism. Because of who you are. But that's life. That's life, you know?'
She continued of her BBL: 'But I love my butt. Don't get me wrong. My booty look nice. And I'm grateful that it looks pretty much… I don't know, sometimes natural, but I don't even care. It's something that I wanted'
