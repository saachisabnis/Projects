For a brief moment, it looked like Kendrick Lamar released a song that could date back to his Section.80 days. “Money Without Me” was posted on his YouTube channel in the late night hours of December 17, but, as of the afternoon of December 18, it’s gone. Pitchfork has reached out to Lamar’s representatives for more information.
Last month, Lamar surprise-released his sixth studio album, GNX, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. He also recently shared a music video for the track “Squabble Up” and announced a 2025 tour with SZA. Lamar is nominated for seven awards at the 2025 Grammys, including Song of the Year, for “Not Like Us.”
