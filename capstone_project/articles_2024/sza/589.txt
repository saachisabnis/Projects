Kendrick Lamar’s booming shout-out to Mustard on GNX‘s “TV Off” has taken social media by storm and even brands like McDonald’s have absorbed the trend. 

Lizzo is clearly a fan of the move and she pulled up to Kai Cenat’s stream over the weekend with SZA and broke out into a Lamar imitation giving Mustard a shout-out of her own.

	“She’s glowing,” Lizzo began. “Mustard!” The scream drew a laugh out of Cenat and SZA along with the thousands virtually watching along in the Mafiathon 2 chat.

	“TV Off” has been crowned an early standout off Lamar’s GNX album and should be making a lofty debut on the Billboard Hot 100 next week. Billboard caught up with Mustard, who co-produced the track and claimed the first part’s beat was a continuation of “Not Like Us” in some ways. 

	“That first half was definitely in the same realm of me making things like ‘Not Like Us.’ And the second half was a beat that I was doing for this other theatrical album that I’m trying to make,” he said. “And I was just like, ‘Man, let me see if Kendrick would like this.’ I sent it to him and he was like, ‘This is crazy.’”

	He appreciated the shout-out from K. Dot too. “That s— was elite,” Mustard lent his stamp of approval. “So fire. Like, is that a new tag? I can’t wait to perform that song and just hear people just saying that, ‘cause everybody’s going to say that like crazy.”
