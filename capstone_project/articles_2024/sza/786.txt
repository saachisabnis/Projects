	Rumors have swirled about SZA potentially teaming up with Paramore in the past, and the SOS artist confirmed that a collaboration is indeed “in the works.”

	SZA sat down for a fan Q&A with Apple Music on Tuesday (Jan. 30), and one of the rapid-fire questions asked about the status of the “Snooze” singer working with the rock band.

	“Yeah. Soon, soon,” she replied. “It’s in the works.”

	Seconds later, SZA revealed that the pop-punk-leaning “F2F” became her favorite song to perform on the SOS Tour. There’s a Paramore connection to the track, as SZA sought out Hayley Williams’ approval on her switching lanes prior to the SOS deep cut’s arrival.

	










	“I was like, ‘Does this suck?'” she recalled messaging the Paramore lead vocalist in an interview with the Los Angeles Times last year. “‘Because you actually do this for a living.’ [Williams] said, ‘This is great.'”

	Paramore has long shown love to SZA, as they performed a mash-up of the band’s “Grow Up” with SZA’s “20 Something” at a 2018 concert in Paris. Years ago, Hayley Williams even posted a brief clip to social media singing along to SZA’s Ctrl standout “Garden.”

	Don’t be surprised if Paramore is listed as a feature on SZA’s upcoming Lana project, which is said to double as the deluxe edition of the Grammy-winning singer’s chart-topping SOS effort. 

	Earlier in January, SZA voiced her frustration and lashed out at anonymous leakers for releasing her music without her permission.

	“LEAKING MY MUSIC IS STEALING . THIS IS MY JOB . THIS IS MY LIFE AND MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. YOU ARE A FUCKING THIEF AND I PROMISE TO PUT MAXIMUM ENERGY INTO HOLDING EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW . I AM TIRED,” SZA wrote on Twitter. 

	SZA previously addressed song leaks in a November interview with Variety: “When people leak my songs, they ruin them,” she declared. “Then it’s not mine anymore; it’s actually yours. It’s something unfinished that you decided was ready to be shared.”
