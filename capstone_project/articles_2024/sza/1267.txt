Baby Rose x BADBADNOTGOOD – “One Last Dance”

Baby Rose announces her upcoming project Slow Burn, which is produced by BADBADNOTGOOD and is scheduled to release on April 12. She also debuts the lead single “One Last Dance,” which was recorded the first day the two artists we met. “I asked for one more, a country song, and when the chords came, I sang from the heart without needing to write the words down,” she says in a statement. “‘One Last Dance’ is important to me because it reflects my feelings of longing and love for someone who sees me as a villain in their story. I used to blame them too, but with time, realized where I was wrong and ultimately hoped for a chance to make it right. There’s a strong part of me that wishes we could try again, pretend it never fell apart, even while knowing it will never be the same. The longing is less about the person and more about the feelings behind the memories we shared. A true testament to the growing pains in life, the music is a sweet underscore of a longing, pride-less goodbye.”

Halle – “In Your Hands”

Halley Bailey drops her new single “In Your Hands,” which arrives with a visual helmed by Anastasia Delmark. “’In Your Hands’ is an incredibly special song to me. It’s basically a message about fighting for a love that you know is an incredibly beautiful one-of-a-kind love, but also a reminder to that special someone that your love has changed their life and is something they won’t experience in this lifetime again,” she says. “It’s a love song but also an empowerment song to ourselves, and a reminder that we are a one of a kind special being and that we’re worth more than all the diamonds and gold in the world.”

Baby Rose x BADBADNOTGOOD – “One Last Dance”

Baby Rose announces her upcoming project Slow Burn, which is produced by BADBADNOTGOOD and is scheduled to release on April 12. She also debuts the lead single “One Last Dance,” which was recorded the first day the two artists we met. “I asked for one more, a country song, and when the chords came, I sang from the heart without needing to write the words down,” she says in a statement. “‘One Last Dance’ is important to me because it reflects my feelings of longing and love for someone who sees me as a villain in their story. I used to blame them too, but with time, realized where I was wrong and ultimately hoped for a chance to make it right. There’s a strong part of me that wishes we could try again, pretend it never fell apart, even while knowing it will never be the same. The longing is less about the person and more about the feelings behind the memories we shared. A true testament to the growing pains in life, the music is a sweet underscore of a longing, pride-less goodbye.”
