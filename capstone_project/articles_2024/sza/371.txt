UPDATE 2/5 11:20 p.m. ET.
Killer Mike released a statement following his arrest.
“I first want to extend my appreciation to the Grammy’s Committee for recognizing me and my team for the work that went into ‘MICHAEL,’” he told Us Weekly. “We are incredibly proud and are basking in this moment. I am also grateful that one of my prayers has been answered – the day after my Grammy win – I learned that my son, who has been on the list for a kidney for years, finally has a match. Obviously, we are elated.”The statement continued, “I do want to note that last night, my team and I fielded a number of calls from concerned fans and colleagues wanting to know if I was OK. I greatly appreciate the concern and support, but I am better than OK. As you can imagine, there was a lot going and there was some confusion around which door my team and I should enter. We experienced an over-zealous security guard but my team and I have the upmost confidence that I will ultimately be cleared of all wrongdoing.”“Until that time, keep listening to ‘Michael,’ and keep going after your dreams,” he concluded.

The Los Angeles Police Department is offering insight into why rapper Killer Mike was arrested at the 2024 Grammy Awards.
“On Sunday February 4th just after 4pm a male adult was detained & handcuffed for a physical altercation that occurred at the 700 block of Chick Hearn Court,” the LAPD shared via X late Sunday night. “The suspect was placed under arrest and was transported to LAPD Central Division.”
In a separate post, the LAPD revealed that the suspect was identified as Michael Render, which is Killer Mike’s real name. He had been “booked for misdemeanor battery” and was being released.
Mike, 48, took home three Grammy Awards on Sunday before his arrest. He won Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for the track “Scientists & Engineers” featuring André 3000, Future and Eryn Allen Kane and received Best Rap Album for his 2023 record, Michael.

“I’m a Black man in America and as a kid, I had a dream to become a part of music. And that 9-year-old is excitedly dancing inside me right now,” Mike said while accepting his Best Rap Performance award. “I want to thank anyone who dares to believe that art can change the world.”
On Monday, February 5, Mike appeared on Audacy’s V-103 and addressed the incident, playing coy about what really went down.
“We hit a speed bump, and then we head back to the party,” he said during the “The Big Tigger Show.”
The Hollywood Reporter’s Chris Gardner sparked concern on Sunday after sharing a video of the musician walking out of the awards ceremony in handcuffs.
“Breaking: Rapper Killer Mike has been taken away in handcuffs in Crypto.com arena after winning 3 #Grammys during telecast (Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance for ‘Scientists & Engineers,’ Best Rap Album for Michael),” he wrote via X, noting that a fan yelled “Free Mike” as the rapper walked by.

“Just spoke to an official who tells me it’s a misdemeanor and has nothing to do with anything that happened today here inside the arena,” a follow-up post read. “Likely he will be released once it’s sorted. ‘It’s a big nothing,’ source says.”
Gardner later spotted Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. speaking with Mike’s team at the arena.
“Around 6:15 p.m., the scene outside the security room where Killer Mike was held dispersed, with LAPD officers exiting the area and members of the rapper’s entourage also moving briskly through the arena,” Gardner wrote before sharing the LAPD’s official statement.
