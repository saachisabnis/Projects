The “Grand National Tour” comes fresh on the heels of Lamar’s surprise album, “GNX,” which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in late November.
The album, which features collaborations with SZA on tracks like “Luther” and “Gloria,” has already dominated the charts with multiple hits. Kendrick’s latest single, “Squabble Up,” recently claimed the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, marking his third No. 1 hit this year.
SZA, who is best known for her critically acclaimed 2022 album “SOS,” is also riding high with the December 20th release of the deluxe version of the album “Lana.” Watch the music video for the album’s single, “Drive,” starring Ben Stiller, below:
