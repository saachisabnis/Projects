Best friends and roommates Dreux (Keke Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA) are about to have One of Them Days. When they discover Alyssa’s boyfriend has blown their rent money, the duo finds themselves going to extremes in a comical race against the clock to avoid eviction and keep their friendship intact.
Playing with VENOM: THE LAST DANCE, check on the funny trailer for ONE OF THEM DAYS.
Palmer last played the role of Emerald Haywood in the 2022 science fiction horror film Nope, directed by Jordan Peele. Her comedic timing and her chemistry with Daniel Kaluuya was perfect.
The film also features Maude Apatow, Lil Rel Howery, Janelle James and Katt Williams.
ONE OF THEM DAYS hits theaters on January 24.
Huge passion for film scores, lives for the Academy Awards, loves movie trailers. That is all.
