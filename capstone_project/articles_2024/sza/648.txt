After a bit of a wait, a release date for SZA‘s SOS deluxe album, Lana, has finally been announced.
Her highly-anticipated album is now scheduled for a December 20 release, with SZA confirming the news via Instagram with a teaser for “Dreams” starring Ben Stiller. The accompanying visual from Severance season two sees the Emmy winner driving in his car, singing along to SZA with a full range of emotions.
Lana was initially announced as early as February of last year, while the Lana title was unveiled in September of 2023. She previously stated that “the deluxe is like a whole other album” with around seven to 10 songs in total. The album is set to drop ahead of her and Kendrick Lamar’s co-headlining tour, which kicks off in April 2025.
