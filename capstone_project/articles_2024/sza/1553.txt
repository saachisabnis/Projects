Iggy Azalea nearly caught the ire of SZA fans after dissing “Solana” on social media, but she was quick to clarify she was referring to crypto, not the singer’s real name.
The mix-up happened on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday (May 27), when the Australian rapper posted, “Who’s solana…? I don’t know that bitch.”

A fan earnestly answered the question and informed Iggy that “Solana” is SZA (who was born Solána Imani Rowe), but Iggy clarified: “Girl im talking about crypto.”
Iggy continued: “And I love sza too! not about to have Stan Twitter rope her into crypto shit hahaha lmaooo.”

Solana, as Azalea noted in a follow-up tweet, is a blockchain platform. It launched in 2020 and uses the SOL cryptocurrency.
Who’s solana…? I don’t know that bitch 🤷‍♀️

Crypto trading may be one of the ventures Iggy Azalea took on after deciding to take a step back from music earlier this year and cancel her next album.
Taking to X (formerly Twitter) in the early morning hours of January 3, the Australian-born rapper wrote a lengthy letter to fans explaining why she was abandoning music for now.

“This is gonna be long….so only bother reading if you love me,” she began. “(If you still bother anyway you’re a weirdo who has been warned. [shrug and laughing emojis]) I’ve always been someone who finds my joy in being creative & seeing my ideas come to life. For a long time I used music to deliver my big crazy ideas to the world.
“I know a lot of people have this idea that I was ‘bullied away from music’ and that’s something I’ve always laughed at because I’d never be bullied out of anything! In fact, I’m too stubborn. I think I’ve even resisted changes within myself at times, purely because I don’t like being viewed as someone who quits.”

She continued: “In truth what I’ve known for a long time is that I feel more passionately about design and creative direction than I do about song writing. To many of you that’s no shock to read. It shows in my work. Haha! Jokes aside, i do spend a lot more time on that part of things… because Im most confident at that.
“That’s why I want to let you know that I’m not going to finish my album. It’s been paused for a few months while I was giving direction for a different project & in truth I just haven’t felt the urge to go back to it. I feel really happy & passionate in my day to day life when my minds focused on that and so I want to stick to what’s undeniably best for me.”

She concluded: “Cant wait to start sharing some of the things I’ve been involved in creating & hoping you’ll see my quirk & humor in anything I touch! I know for some fans this probably makes you feel a little deflated — I’m sorry to let you down. But, it’s more important I don’t let myself down. I hope you’ll understand. Talk soon! I Love you.”
When prompted by a reply, Iggy added that “it’s all cool weird stuff” that she’s working on and that she’s been in this new space for a minute but felt like she “should share [it] with the class.”
