Latto has unveiled the tracklist for her forthcoming album Sugar Honey Iced Tea, and it features the likes of Megan Thee Stallion, Ciara and more.
The Georgia native took to Instagram with a photo of the back cover of the LP on Wednesday (August 7). Meg actually appears twice on the 21-track effort, first on a new song titled “Squeeze,” then again on their previously-released “Sunday Service Remix,” which also features Flo Milli.

The latter appears as a bonus track along with the original “Sunday Service,” 2023’s “Put It On Da Floor” and its accompanying Cardi B-assisted remix, “Put It On Da Floor Again.”
Young Nudy, Hunxho, Coco Jones, Mariah The Scientist and Teezo Touchdown also make appearances.

“When the album drop pls listen in order & don’t skip big mama just cuz it’s already out I put a lot of effort into the sequence ,” Latto added in the caption.
Sugar Honey Iced Tea arrives on all streaming platforms on Friday (August 9).
Latto previously announced Sugar Honey Iced Tea, which stands to be her third studio effort, with a cinematic trailer that features cameos from 2 Chainz and T.I.
Inspired by the 2006 cult movie ATL (which starred T.I.), the clip teases a collaboration with SZA as her vocals can be briefly heard during the trailer. However, her name did not appear on the newly-released tracklist.

The trailer, which is narrated by Dungeon Family member Big Rube, whose voice also appeared in ATL, concludes by revealing the release date for Sugar Honey Iced Tea.
T.I.’s “24’s” can also be heard in the video, suggesting that Latto will be sampling the 2003 classic on her new album. She recently previewed an unreleased song that samples the hard-hitting DJ Toomp beat and puts a female spin on the song’s hook.

“[Aesthetically], I’ve been pulling from Mariah Carey, Beyoncé and Lil Kim. [Musically], I’ve been pulling from Kelis, but obviously with a Southern Hip Hop twist,” she said of the album in a recent Billboard cover story. “They have very feminine energy, but masculine in the sense of confidence. I feel like they was boss bitches.
“It just gave ‘I’m that girl.’ When you hear and see them in that prime era, it gave ‘I’m here to stay.’ In a world where everybody do music, I’m looking up to the G.O.A.T.s at this shot. Ain’t no microwave artists here. I’m tryna be here for a minute… I am going to be here for a minute. I’ve been here for a minute already.”

She added: “I love the music that I’m making right now. I’m not chasing achievements. I’m just doing me. This is the happiest I’ve been to the point where I even told the label [to] fall back. I’m in the studio — I don’t want y’all sending me no beats, no songs, nothing. I’m doing what I want to do. I really haven’t been this confident for a project yet.”
