By Mike Kennedy: The 66th annual Grammy Awards ceremony was held in Los Angeles on February 4. You can see the full list of categories, winners, and nominees here in the Wikipedia.
I have attempted to collect a list of genre-related winners below. Some of them have only a fairly tentative connection, but most of them are pretty solid. The least solid would be “Ghost in the Machine” which is mostly talking about social media, but also touches on AI.
You can see lyrics for most or all of these songs plus interpretations (of various quality) made by readers and critics at genius.com.

The very-definitely SFnal Janelle Monae was up for at least one, but didn’t win.
