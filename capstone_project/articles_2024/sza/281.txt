This week Paris Fashion Week for the menswear Fall/Winter 2024 season kicked off, attracting designers, models, editors, stylists and more not just to the French capital, but to their laptops. In this fashion world, the new year always kicks off in high gear as it represents the beginning of some of fashion’s major tentpole events across the globe.
For this Paris Fashion Week, there have already several big moments ranging from Pharrell Williams’ third runway show for Louis Vuitton to Rick Owens sending swollen warriors down the runway. Whether it be avant-garde, minimalist, tailoring-focused or streetwear designs, this week’s PFW has seen new collections from brands like Wales Bonner, Dries Van Noten, AMI, HOMME PLISSÉ ISSEY MIYAKE, Yohji Yamamoto and more.

It’s no secret that Nigo and Pharrell have had a longtime relationship – co-founding Billionaire Boys Club and its sub-label ICECREAM alongside other creative endeavors. Now their relationship is getting even deeper as Pharrell has been tapped by Nigo to be an official advisor for his HUMAN MADE label.
“He didn’t have an official role and I thought it was time to make it official that he’s actually advising on the direction of the brand,” Nigo told WWD. “I’ve really just started talking about it with Pharrell now in this position, and Brian Donnelly [aka Kaws] is also an adviser,” he continued. “So now the three of us are officially going to have this responsibility and we’re going to start working out plans.”
Nigo previously brought in Pharrell to help at the brand, but now his new role makes it official.
Dior Will Bring Its FW24 Collection to New York City’s Brooklyn Museum

















Dior




Aside from American brands, New York City is continuing to be a destination city for European brands to exhibit their latest collection with names like Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Marni, Fendi and more taking to the Big Apple in recent years. Now, Dior has announced that it is holding its FW24 womenswear collection at the Brooklyn Museum.
Defined as a “spellbinding défilé,” by the house, the forthcoming show looks to the “unwavering ties forged between Dior and the United States from the very beginning of the house.” Beyond that, the show will look specifically at NYC’s role in the house’s stylistic evolution.
The show is set to break ground in NYC on Monday, April 15.

Now Kim Kardashian’s brand is adding Lana Del Rey into the mix with its new Valentine’s Day campaign.
“I’ve been a big fan of SKIMS since the beginning, so being featured in their Valentine’s campaign is so exciting,” Del Rey said in a statement, per Variety. “Their collection is so pretty and dreamy, which made collaborating with Nadia on the creative so fun. I hope you love it as much as I do.”
