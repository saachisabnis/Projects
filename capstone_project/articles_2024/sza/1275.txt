T-Pain, Ludacris, Sean Paul and more artists who haven’t been added to the Coachella lineup have decided to perform at another festival of their own.
According to Billboard, the lineup for the Revolve Festival — which also includes Ying Yang Twins, Nina Sky, Siobhan Bell and Kim Lee — was announced on Wednesday (March 27). The show is set to take place during the Coachella festival on April 13 in Palm Springs, CA.

This will be the seventh annual edition of the Revolve Festival, which previously featured performances by Post Malone, Jack Harlow, Cardi B, Ice Spice, Willow, Migos, Offset, SZA, Travis Scott, A$AP Rocky, 21 Savage, Chance the Rapper, Snoop Dogg and Tyga.
“Like every year when planning the artist lineup, we look to our community for inspiration,” said Raissa Gerona, Revolve’s chief brand officer, in a statement. “This year was no different. We decided to lean into the Y2K craze with artists from this era.”

Last week, T-Pain made headlines when he appeared on a new song by Meghan Trainor titled “Been Like This,” and she was so grateful for the collaboration that she paid for a full-page ad in an Atlanta newspaper to thank him.
In a video shared to his TikTok account on March 18, an incredulous Pain read the ad aloud in amazement.

“This is the craziest thing that anybody’s ever done. Period,” he said. “I have a song with Meghan Trainor — it just came out yesterday — and Meghan Trainor took out a full-page ad in the Atlanta newspaper to say thank you to me.
“Look,” he added, holding up a copy of the paper. “It’s the actual freaking newspaper bro. ‘This letter of appreciation is for the one and only T-Pain. The first time I heard your music, I knew I had found my favorite artist of all time. Your musicality and lyrics blew my mind. Rhyming ‘Wisconsin’ and ‘mansion’ is expert-level songwriting and it motivated me to no end.
