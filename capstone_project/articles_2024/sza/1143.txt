Alabama rap star - and former DIY cover star - Flo Milli has dropped her latest track ‘Wet Dreams’, a new collab featuring fellow risers coop & G G. 
It’s her first release since the arrival of third album ‘Fine Ho, Stay’ earlier this year - the final part of the LP trilogy started by her 2020 debut ‘Ho, why is you here ?’ and continued by 2022’s ‘You Still Here, Ho ?’. 
Having previously worked with the likes of SZA, Cardi B, Monaleo and more, Flo’s new cut sees her team up with LEFF for ‘Wet Dreams” official video - a sensual, ’90s tinged visual that’s doused in atmospheric blue mood lighting. 
You can revisit our 2022 cover interview with Flo and watch the video for ‘Wet Dreams’ below. 
Flo Milli may have started her career with a series of viral moments, but heading into debut LP "You Still Here, Ho?' the rapper is aiming for progress, success and longevity.
