Muni Long has had enough — and not just anybody can take ownership of songs she writes.
On Thursday, in a post on Instagram and TikTok, the Grammy-winning singer and songwriter gave fans a peek into what she told Elliot Grainge, the president of Atlantic Records.
In the video, Long used a voiceover of Boosie Badazz saying, “F**k no! And I’mma stand on that. And they can get in my DM–you can get in my DM all you want, every day.”
The text in the video reads, “Me to the president of Atlantic asking me to write ‘Soulful’ songs for non melanated artists.”

But Long’s rant didn’t end there. She then wrote a lengthy caption, saying, “And when I said NO one of em gone say ‘You can reach in that Priscilla Renea vault and see what you have in there.’ Boy do you know what a VAULT is? That’s where you keep the valuables. If you don’t get somewhere and sit down. I wanted to cuss them out so bad ya’ll.
This garnered some reactions from some notable artists, including SZA, who wrote in the comment section on Instagram, “OKAAAAYYYY CAUSE KNOCK IT OFF.”
While this particular post may seem like a joke to some, Long’s services are extremely coveted in the music industry. She’s written for some of the most popular and successful artists over the years, including Rihanna, Mary J. Blige, and Mariah Carey.
In the past, she’s even written for “non-melanated” artists like Kelly Clarkson, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Madonna.
It’s also interesting that she was asked by the president of Atlantic Records, even though she is signed to Def Jam.
Long’s services may have become more sought-after in the last few years due to her success as a solo artist. At the 2023 Grammys, she won an award for Best R&B Performance for her song “Hrs and Hrs.”
She’s also been nominated for Best R&B Performance, Best Traditional R&B Performance, Best R&B Song, and Best R&B Album for the 2025 Grammys.
