Rumors of Flo Milli’s pregnancy were sparked earlier this month after she posted a video dancing with a masked man who was rubbing on her protruding stomach.
The video was intended to preview her new song, which samples T-Pain‘s “I’m N Luv (Wit A Stripper)” and finds Flo rapping: “He eat it up in the backseat/ I’m running like it’s a track meet/ I know this boy wanna trap me – okay!/ He wanna give me a baby/ I want him to give me Mercedes!”

But Flo played coy at first, taking to X moments later and writing, “damn i cant be bloated??”
