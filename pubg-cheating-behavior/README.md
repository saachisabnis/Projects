Homophily and Social Contagion of Cheating in PUBG
This project investigates the dynamics of cheating behavior in the multiplayer online game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), focusing on two core mechanisms: homophily (cheaters tend to associate with each other) and social contagion (exposure to cheaters increases the likelihood of adopting cheating behavior).

Objectives
Determine whether cheaters are more likely to team up with other cheaters than expected by chance.

Examine whether players exposed to cheaters — through teaming up, observing, or being killed by them — are more likely to become cheaters.

Simulate randomized game scenarios to establish baseline expectations and compare them to real-world behavior.

Methodology
Analysis is performed using game interaction and behavior data from PUBG.

Simulated "alternative universes" are created to establish what cheating exposure would look like under random conditions.

The project isolates the effects of interaction types (teammates, observers, victims) on future cheating behavior.

Technical Details
All data cleaning, manipulation, and simulation logic was implemented using pure Python, without external libraries such as pandas or numpy.
