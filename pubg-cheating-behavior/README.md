# Homophily and Social Contagion of Cheating in PUBG

This project investigates the dynamics of cheating behavior in the multiplayer online game **PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)**, focusing on two core mechanisms:

- **Homophily** – Cheaters tend to associate with other cheaters.
- **Social Contagion** – Exposure to cheaters increases the likelihood of adopting cheating behavior.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- ✅ Determine whether cheaters are more likely to team up with other cheaters than expected by chance.
- ✅ Examine whether players exposed to cheaters — through teaming up, observing, or being killed by them — are more likely to become cheaters.
- ✅ Simulate randomized game scenarios to establish baseline expectations and compare them to real-world behavior.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

- Analyzed PUBG match and player behavior data to observe cheating patterns.
- Created **simulated "alternative universes"** in which players were randomly assigned teammates or killers to measure expected cheating exposure under random conditions.
- Compared real-world behavior to these randomized baselines to identify statistically significant patterns.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- All data processing, simulation, and analysis were implemented in **pure Python**.
- No external libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`) were used — code is written using only built-in Python functionality.
