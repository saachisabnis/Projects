## Research Question and Data {.smaller}

🧠 **Research Question**

-   Can we predict h01 responses – *“**Should environment or economic growth be prioritized?**”* – from other survey items?

📊 **Data** (BES 2019 cross-sectional)

-   h01 (10 point scale) recoded into 3 separate classes:
    -   Environment Priority (7–10), Middle (4–6) and Growth Priority (0–3)

🧹 **Preprocessing**

-   Dropped variables with \>55% missingness

-   Recoded structural missing values as a new "Not Applicable" class

-   Used SMOTE to balance imbalanced class sizes (\~55% Env, 37% Mid, 8% Growth)

🔎 **Why Multi-Class?**
  
-   Binary (env vs. growth) model showed marginally better performance  
-   But multi-class retained to capture *moderate views* — key for policy nuance

## Modelling Approach & Challenges {.smaller}

-   **XGBoost** used for multi-class prediction  
    - Handles non-linear patterns & interactions across survey items

-   Challenge:
    -  Substantial class overlap in PCA space makes preferences hard to distinguish → model fundamentally limited by non-separability
    -  Class imbalance compounds difficulty (e.g. Growth group rarely separable)
    -  Replication on BES 2017 confirms similar structure and class entanglement

```

## Results & Interpretations {.smaller}

- Model predicts pro-Environment views reasonably well (Sensitivity ≈ 78%)

- Poor performance on Growth and Middle priorities
    - Growth group rarely identified (~5% sensitivity; precision also low at 38%)
    - Middle group inconsistently predicted (~47% sensitivity)

- Strongest predictors include **Green Party affinity, left–right ideology, ethical consumerism and support for income redistribution**
    - Suggests H01 reflects broader ideological alignment, not just single-issue concern (trend replicated in BES 2017)

## Conclusions & Implications {.smaller}


1. **Model performance reveals class imbalance challenges**
   - Accurately predicts Environment group (Sensitivity ≈ 78%)
   - Growth class too small (~8%) for stable learning, even after SMOTE
   - Top predictors (e.g. Green Party affinity, left–right ideology) support construct validity of H01

2. **Multi-class model retains important nuance**
   - Binary model simplifies attitudes, but collapses moderates into extremes
   - Middle category captures ambivalent or conflicted views — key for understanding centrist or swing/undecided voters

3. **Recommendation: Retain H01 in future BES surveys**
   -  Model cannot reliably recover responses for key subgroups — especially Growth-oriented respondents
   -  Dropping H01 risks under-representing respondents with economic or moderate priorities, limiting the survey’s ability to capture the full range of public opinion.
