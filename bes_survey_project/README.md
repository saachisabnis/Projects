# BES Survey Project – Predicting Environmental Preference

This project required me to develop a machine learning model to assess whether certain survey items can be accurately predicted using responses to other items, in order to shorten lengthy national surveys without sacrificing data quality.

Specifically, I worked with data from the British Election Study (BES) to evaluate the viability of removing a question (item H1) on individuals’ prioritisation of the environment over the economy. The goal was to predict responses to this item using other variables available in the same cross-sectional survey dataset.

### Task Overview

- I assumed the role of a data scientist working for the BES.
- I trained an individual-level prediction model using BES data to assess whether item H1 could be reliably predicted.
- The deliverable was a concise, 4-slide presentation intended for an academic audience, summarising my approach, model performance, key findings, and limitations.

### Key Requirements

- Use of at least 2 visualisations across the slide deck.
- A maximum of 3 main bullet points per slide, with optional supporting indented bullets.
- Submission of the final knitted HTML slide deck, created using an RMarkdown template provided by the course.

### Technologies Used

- **R** (including `tidyverse`, `caret`, and `tidymodels`)
- **RMarkdown** for slide creation
