## Power Analysis for correlations and regression

Here, for this study, we can use the power analysis for a correlation to identify how many people to include in our study for it to have a power of 0.8.
Since, using an effect size of 0.25 is standard practice in psychological research, I will use this for my power analysis. 


```{r}
pwr.r.test(r = .25, sig.level = .05, power =.80)
```
These results show that in order to that to achieve the desired power level of 0.80 at a significance level of 0.05 with the specified effect size of 0.2 for correlation, the study requires a sample size of 122 participants.
