The primary reason to continue listening to her music no matter her actions is because of the quality of the music itself c the way it’s been integrated into society, as well as my own life due to its long time presence. The impact of Taylor swifts carbon footprint does not affect my listening as much because I think she is politically active in other spheres, as well as providing a in demand service with her concerts, whixh is why I would not cancel her. While I have engaged in buying tickets for her concerts, I don’t ‘support her financially’ through other means because I don’t associate with the Taylor swift fan base in that way. I also think supporting her financially is maybe not the best way to phrase this action because sometimes it’s about social belonging and signaling rather than driven by the motivation to be a part of this artists life ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I personally find that her music means so much to me I don’t think I would stop listening to her music. The change that would occur, for me anyway, is that I would be less invested in her and her life. I would only be associated her by her music alone. She produces quality on a historical level, evidenced by many groundbreaking awards. And it doesn’t mean she should be given a free card to do whatever she likes. I just feel that her music exists and should be respected in its own right. Discussing cancel culture, I think it is a reflection on society that back in 2016 the internet ‘cancelled’ Taylor Swift when it was Kanye West who called her a b***h. That was inappropriate, alongside the extremely derogatory music video. People were okay with that but not okay with a woman saying she had been manipulated. Hatred of her is rooted in misogyny. When people criticise her, for example her carbon emissions, I always acknowledge this. But she can’t take a commercial flight, as evidenced by the recent stalker news. I acknowledge she has faults in that regard but I dislike it when people judge her based on the sole negative comments circulating in the media rather than her very many credible achievements. People who don’t even care about the environment will use that as an excuse to hate on her.",0
